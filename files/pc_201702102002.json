Is the talk about role of the Team Lead in an environment with or without a formal Architect? Also, what is not fully clear is whether the talk is about some of the management related activities a technical lead need to do or much on the technical side with or without an Architect.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there is a theme that talks about “developing software architects, including coaching, mentoring, certification, professional training, and college education”.

In agile projects, this means being part of every sprint that needs architecturally significant decisions. In order to do this successful, a good collaboration between the technical lead and the architect is necessary. What I've regularly seem in practice, is that both roles are not always present in the same team: some projects might be to small (budget, man days, scope, ...) while many others are organised sub-optimal. One of your review-colleagues also pointed this out.\r\n\r\nBoth roles have some things in common (eg. leadership) and some of the tips I want to provide, should assist in creating this synergy: as a technical lead pay attention to architectural decisions, collaborate on the decision-making process. Get involved. You can see that this requires a different approach with or without a formal architectural role. I too often saw technical leads putting all their focus on \"tools\" and \"frameworks\" and I believe this alone is not enough to deliver successful systems (and sometimes it can be enough). Leadership is about being able to delegate, collaborate (with architects, developers, business people, ... stakeholders). An architect should embrace working with a technical lead, guide him, elevate him. And a technical lead should also embrace working with an architect: support him with technical options, ...\r\n\r\nI strongly believe collaboration will aid both roles to perform better and become better. The roles have both similarities and differences. And that's a really good thing.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nBart Blommaerts","created_at":"2017-01-24T08:25:28.238Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T08:25:28.238Z"},{"id":3601,"submission_id":7199,"talk_id":13762,"user":{"name":"Ged Byrne","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef4de37718ebb5c4fc1c2236331ee9d9?s=500","email":"ged.byrne@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Bart,\r\n\r\nThanks for replying.

However, I'm not so interested in the implementation details.\r\n\r\nI would love to see a talk provide an good, practical overview of the topic for the architect.  This is an area of debate for architects, so I think it is a very relevant field for discussion.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the first addition of \"Software Architecture in Practice\" the statement was made: \"Making a system's user interface clear and easy to use is primarily a matter of getting the details of a user's interaction correct … but these details are not architectural.\"\r\n\r\nIn later editions this position was retracted with a section called \"Usability Mea Culpa (or that’s not Architecture)\" but other architects still disagree.  Consider this blog post that insists that usability is important, but still not architecture: http://enterprise-it-architecture.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/usability-is-not-architecture-quality.html\r\n\r\nAs somebody with a passion for and experience of achieving accessibility, could you explain to architects why this is an important quality attribute and the role that architects play in improving it?\r\n\r\nIf you could include some well defined quality scenarios [1] and relevant architectural tactics [2] that would be very desirable.  The testing approach would be covered by the tactics and you might want to focus on this in particular.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this would be quite a deviation from your current proposal.  You may think of something closer to what you already have that will help to convince architects that this is something they need to be interested in.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=4\r\n[2] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=5\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z"},{"id":3640,"submission_id":7723,"talk_id":14675,"user":{"name":"Gerard Cohen","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/3931/GerardKCohen400x400.jpeg","email":"gerardkcohen@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Ged,\r\n\r\nI can understand why architects do not feel that usability, or UI, belongs in the realm of architecture. I can tell you from my own personal experiences that bad/ lazy service architecture can definitely impact and lead to bad UI. A lot of times, these things are in the name of security or performance and sometimes they can be smoothed over on the front end, but most times they can't. Speaking as a Front-End architect, performance is just as much a part of usability as accessibility is. \r\n\r\nI would agree that implementation of accessibility will not be of any interest to most architects, unless they are front-end like myself. But if you are interested in having the discussion of how bad architecture could lead to bad usability, I certainly have a few anecdotes that I could share.","created_at":"2017-01-25T03:33:17.197Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T03:33:17.197Z"},{"id":3644,"submission_id":7723,"talk_id":14675,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"There was a great [talk on globalization last year at SATURN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPabgSykvD8&list=PLSNlEg26NNpy1RjhlISNMRNO1gypYaXHo).

At the same time, it seems that most of web accessibility is related to implementation details - color choice, proper tagging, good naming, navigation orders for JAWS, etc.\r\n\r\nI think the goal for most SATURN attendees would not be to become an accessibility expert, but to learn enough to not make bad trade-offs as Gerard mentioned (e.g. security over accessibility) or at least be aware that trade-offs are happening.  The proposed talk will go into significant detail that I don't think will be of general interest.  I realize that's a little sad since this is an important topic.  I think a shorter talk that gives a good overview and emphasizes the top things an architect should know might be a better fit for the audience.\r\n\r\nGerard -- What are your thoughts for your proposal based on the feedback?

An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices","description":"An invisible app? An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices\r\nI know what you're thinking. You want to know what the triple-A app titles already know. It's Inclusive Design, a process to deliver intuitive usability; it is the heart-and-soul of great User Experience and innovative interactions. Your app is in a cosmic battle with the Uninstall button; inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor. Appeal to your largest audience, provide cohesive experiences, and reduce development costs. It is an investment with one of the best returns in all of software. It's simple, cheap and awesome.\r\n\r\nApplication security is fundamental to software from initial design to every line developed. Security should not be an afterthought. Similarly, usability has this same ubiquity throughout the life-cycle of software. The fastest, most secure, most scalable software can end up in the trash because it misses the most important success criteria for any program in the universe - user acceptance. Software architecture profoundly impacts usability. Usability profoundly impacts acceptance. Architects may not choose app colors, error messages, and device layout, but they certainly make choices that enable and constrain designers options that make our software better. Like security is everyone’s responsibility at some level, so is usability at some level.\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees learn? Inclusive design isn’t only usability; it’s recognizing that your user base changes as their social and environmental contexts change. If your user is standing in the sun, waiting for a train in the snow, holding a baby, riding a bus, visiting a library or watching the big game in a sports bar, applications can account for the one type of user that, given a certain context, looks and acts like another type of user. Inclusive design helps developers understand these contexts. It applies these to our implementations to add modalities, flexibility in workflows, and intentional tolerance for user mistakes. Developers will learn to recognize contextual assumptions and apply new, potential contexts to their existing user base so they can serve them best while consequently serving a new, larger user base.

Generally I cover the internals to illustrate why Concourse is a good solution for a specific case within CI/CD, but I can also move more towards a generalist CI/CD strategy talk where Concourse is simple an illustration of a solution to a specific problem.\r\n\r\nA specific example I cover is how testing commits to various microservice repos can be integrated together into a pipeline that eventually deploys software externally, and I show an example Concourse pipeline that illustrates this.

The double proposals leave it up to us to judge what is the best way to get your message across, which may or may not work in your benefit.\r\n\r\nI like the building a team aspect of your talk, architects often double as leads in one way or another, with or without reporting line responsibility.

Now having read both proposals, I'd recommend you to update the 30 min session to a focussed talk with a clear value proposition for architects and lead-developers. Dropping more technical material.

The presentation is not hands on, where as the workshop is. Many people find that they learn better if they actually play with the tools. Playing with the tools is what happens in This workshop. The workshop will work well if we can get the VM I have to attendees before the workshop. Attendees need to have this setup and runable before the workshop, otherwise it usually takes up to much time during the workshop. If we can get a network share setup that attendees can download the VM, and follow the directions I provide before the workshop then it usually works well. Also having a box of NTFS formatted 16GB USB sticks loaded with my VM, that can be handed out on and/or during the conference or even in the workshop, has worked well as a backup plan.\r\n\r\nThis submission can also be run as a tutorial, which takes less time, due to the non hands on nature, no one has to set anything up other than myself. If run as a tutorial, I just run through the tooling parts as a workshop myself. This way attendees get more of an idea how things fit together than they would if it was just the short presentation.\r\n\r\nNumbers also play a part in what works best. If a large number of people wish to attend, then the presentation works best. If over 20 - 30 developers attend, then usually the workshop turns into more of a tutorial, unless, we are really organised and attendees are fully setup before the tutorial/workshop. I have 4 USB  sticks that I can pass around during the workshop, but this only works if there are 20 or less developers in the class.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, the workshop offers the most, but only if you can support the facilities required and both of us provide excellent comms to people wishing to attend the workshop in the weeks and days leading up to it. My preference is the presentation, as it is less work, but it's your call, I'm happy to run either.\r\n\r\nI have run quite a few training's similar to this before:\r\n\r\nNodeConfEU (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#security-regression-testing-with-zapapi-and-nodegoat-nodeconf-eu) was a similar workshop (45 people in the class), that may have ended up more of a tutorial, but didn't as we had a box of USB sticks loaded and a network share and had good comms with the attendees before the session.\r\n\r\nDevSecCon (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#devseccon-asia-2017-developing-a-high-performance-security-focussed-agile-team-2-hour-workshop) is aiming to host a similar workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, developers/engineers generally get a lot out of this. For me, I generally try not to differentiate to much between devs and architects. An excellent architect should still have their hands on the tools, it's just that they are also expected to be in a lot of other places at the same time. For the architects with less hands on involvement, the tutorial or even presentation style may be best suited to them. In saying that though, if everyone is setup before the workshop, then I can usually hold hands fairly firmly through the hands on content.\r\n\r\nThe content, whether hands on or not, in many cases is quite eye opening, so there are good take aways for all. My last presentation at AgileNZ (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#agilenz2016-agile-security-for-web-developers-50-minute-presentation) which was mostly targeted toward developers, was still well received by the audience which were mostly Product Owners, Managers and Architects. The AgileNZ presentation had quite a bit of the same content as what I've submitted here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high and low level together is what my book series addresses and encourages development teams (PO's, Managers, Architects, Engineers) to grasp and understand. First chapter being 30'000 foot view, which leads into 10,000 foot view, then into some fairly detailed asset identification, risk identification, countermeasure identification, etc... based on Bruce Schneier's Sensible Securitty Model (SSM). The content teaches all people involved in the process of building technical solutions to think outside of their tunnel vision. Architects to think about low level details and Engineers to think holistically, hence the title: \"Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developer\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by clear value proposition? Does the following not provide this:\r\n\"have proven their value in:\r\n(1) Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market)\r\n(2) Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs)\r\n(3) Without descoping\r\nand all while reducing total project cost (fact)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be happy for some assistance to formulate this better for SATURN if you would be keen to help?\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that has clarified most of it?\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z"},{"id":3622,"submission_id":8056,"talk_id":15299,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Kim, thank you for the clarification!

In the dojos I have setup / ran, teams are building their products while learning new skills and directly applying them to what they are building.  To give you an example, the last team I was with was building an OAuth service to be used by multiple front-ends.  So they were learning OAuth, along with microservices (Spring Boot in this case), while building with drone / gradle, deploying via kubernetes...all done test driven.  We were doing this in the frame of building their product.  For the majority of the people - it was two teams, about a total of 10 developers - these were new skills. So instead of reading a site and trying to apply something or take a course in one topic, we sat and worked directly with teams on how to build 'the right product, the right way.'  Other teams have learned Java (coming from mainframe), mobile development, etc.  I have even ran these with non-technical teams like L&D or marketing.\r\n\r\nSo what goes on?  Learning in the context of building your stuff.\r\n\r\nI am of course biased to a dojo approach - I like the idea of whole teams learning together in their context.  I would offer up that if you just have a single skill that needs to be amplified, a dojo wouldn't be right.

Unfortunately, most quality goals will not and those that do are unlikely to emerge early.\r\n\r\nInternal quality goals such as code understandability and testability, will never emerge from domain understanding.  Some high-profile external goals such as safety, security, and privacy may emerge, but at unpredictable times.  Others, such as ease of use, reliability, and responsiveness, will emerge if there are gross quality failures.  A focus on functionality will delay emergence of most quality goals.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, waiting for quality goal emergence is a poor idea and unnecessary.  Waiting results in the accumulation of sizable technical debt during early iterations.  Debt piles up because quality support functions, such as exception handlers, are missing everywhere.\r\n\r\nUse of a comprehensive quality model enables quality goals to be identified early.  It also enables the early specification of both quality achievement and quality verification strategies.  Such a quality model is freely available at www.quality-aware.com/q-a-daves-stuff.php.  The steps to fix Agile and any other incremental development process can be found at www.quality-aware.com.\r\n\r\nSEI publications state that understanding quality goals is an important prerequisite to good architectural decisions.  This suggests that most quality goals should be identified early.  This conflicts with stated Agile beliefs and current Agile practice.  The SEI has been silent on this conflict.  It is time to speak up and campaign for Quality-Aware Agile.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will\r\n•\tExplore current quality practices with attendees\r\n•\tDescribe why Agile and every incremental development process is broken\r\n•\tDescribe the added tasks of Quality-Aware development\r\n•\tSimulate a review and tailoring of the LiteRM quality model in an inspection overview format\r\n•\tExplore objections to using these proposals with attendees","notes":"None","abstract":"Agilists believe that Big Requirements Up Front is an Agile anti-pattern.

This presentation is based on my real-world experiences in salvaging two multiple-million dollar projects in a very short period. Neither project conducted architecture quality attributes workshop (QAW). The performance issues were so severe that the projects were subject to be cancelled. The root of causes were extensive data aggregation with heavy computation and sorting on a low-end databases. One of the two projects simply tried to reuse a simple mobile application architecture with 2 search criteria and less than 100 thousand records on a PostgreSQL to a full blown application with 100 million records with over 20 search criteria. When performance issues appeared at UAT, $2 million dollars were already invested in the project. I will present a quick turnaround options including tailored solutions ranging from increasing hardware / network capacity, database tuning / query optimization, API optimization, to the implementation of Solr or Elasticsearch to address the performance issue. The examples I will use in the presentation will be performance and storage trade-offs that leverage the Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time. The architectural dynamics, challenges, and impacts such as Solr indexing time impact to the existing ETL process and PaaS issues will also be presented.

I think the talk description uses the term SLA inaccurately. SLA is a document that may specify perfomance requirements, among other things. I'd argue that the majority of software systems out there do not have such a document in effect. So, saying \"The performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a non-functional requirement that is used as an acceptance criteria for almost every project / system\" is an overstatement to me. But if you drop the term \"Service Level Agreement (SLA)\", the sentence sounds quite valid. \r\n\r\n2. Likewise, the SLA document doesn't impact usability. It's performance that affects usability. \r\n\r\n3. The talk description uses quite some space to discuss the general importance of performance as a quality attribute requirement. I believe that's not the focus of the talk, but as is the description becomes less interesting, because many SATURN attendees are well aware that performance requirements are important. The title and description could be more specific and clearly indicate what kind of performance optimization is discussed. In other words, I suggest you say in the title and abstract what specific kind of performance solution you'll present. \r\n\r\n4. You say \"The probable cause is a lack of defined architecture quality attributes and vague non-functional requirements on performance at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\" It's not clear to me what is \"defined architecture quality attributes\" versus \" non-functional requirements on performance.\"  Also, I think it would make more sense to say \"at an early stage of the architectural design\" instead of \"at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\"\r\n\r\n5. The phrase \"I will also discuss detailed issue resolution approaches to address performance concerns from end-to-end\"  sounds very general and hence too ambitious. Maybe you should be more specific, such as \"... performance concerns from end-to-end in systems that deal with text search on indexed data sets. \r\n\r\n6. The term \"storage trade-offs\" is not clear. Is is about tradeoffs regarding the choice of infrastructure used for persisting data? Maybe RDBMS vs NoSQL databases? Maybe tradeoffs related to Lucene indexing options? \r\n\r\n7. SATURN attendees are interested in technologies, tools, frameworks that have been used successfully. So, in an unbiased fashion, you could try to mention tools such as profilers and performance monitors that you have used. Learning about the experience of others with such tools may raise the interest in your talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"sorting from back**end database to Solr \"\r\n\r\n- \"and be access*ed* over http\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z"},{"id":3747,"submission_id":8268,"talk_id":15740,"user":{"name":"George Fairbanks","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7617/George-Fairbanks.png","email":"gf@georgefairbanks.com"},"body":"I'm drawn to this talk because of the specifics of the case studies as described in the Notes section.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. Today Software Architecture is taught at many undergrad and graduate academic programs in the US and abroad. Also, there are many professional training classes available. Some are vendor agnostic (such as the SEI courses), others are offered by vendors, such as Microsoft and Oracle. In your presentation, do you consider taking classes on software architecture an effective possible step in the roadmap? \r\n\r\n2. The software architect should also have a clear understanding of quality attributes, such as modifiability, availability, performance, and security. He/she should know how to elicit and document quality attribute requirements, because these requirements are the most important architecture drivers. \r\n\r\n3. The architect should also understand that architecture consists of multiple structures, which are documented in multiple views. He/she should know how to communicate the multi-view architecture effectively. Many times this communication involves diagrams, so the architect should know UML or know how to create and use an informal diagram notation consistently. \r\n\r\n4. A question that could be discussed in your presentation: is there value in pursuing one of the different available software architecture certifications? \r\n\r\n5. The architect should also know how to create, document, and evaluate an architecture. \r\n\r\n6. Years ago people at the SEI software architecture group engaged in a discussion about the duties, skills and knowledge of an architect. One of the results of that discussion is on [this web page](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/research/previousresearch/duties.cfm). It might have useful information for your presentation. \r\n\r\n7. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n8. It would be interesting to see a discussion of what has changed in recent years in the role of architect in the \"digital era\", the era of microservices, containers, and agile development. \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T20:02:45.410Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T20:02:45.410Z"},{"id":3947,"submission_id":7996,"talk_id":15195,"user":{"name":"Pradyumn Sharma","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c5b87d50700eeed460070d11880dc17?s=500","email":"pradyumn.sharma@gmail.com"},"body":"Hello Paulo,\r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestions and inputs. \r\n\r\n1.

Different nodes on different machines try to communicate with each other as well different devices and controllers do. \r\nThese IoT devices can certainly connect through a lot of different ways, but in this talk I focus on cellular connectivity. Obviously, other receptions are always limited to the access point, and also dependent on network and device configurations. Cellular has reception everywhere without any maintenance effort from the customer side, so with telecom access a large-scale investigation is possible. Given the ubiquity of sim based IoT devices, cellular solutions can achieve an unbelievable level of coverage in both space and time for observing any events.\r\nIf we take IoT and wanna use it in a large scale for example in agriculture industry in Africa, we have to built a suitable large architecture. As low-energy network does not exist there and can provide connectivity only on one site, so the communication with the combine on the field will be always insecure. Even SMS can play a role as an intermediate solution and help with device distribution or middleware. GSM network always can be used, even if internet is not available, which makes it reliable and persistent channel for IoT connectivity.\r\nIn my talk I include not only an agriculture, but also e-health, logistic and alarm system cases, with journey map and code demonstration.\r\n\r\nCheers, Karina","created_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z"}]},{"id":6786,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2016-11-30T04:43:58.355Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T21:17:09.133Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVTF4vXmw-c","rating":25.75,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["quality attribute models","essentially complex models","quality goals"],"profile":{"name":"David Gelperin","bio":"David Gelperin is CTO of ClearSpecs Enterprises.

My initial thought was that you were saying \"Software Quality Attributes Considered Harmful.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, reading the introduction paragraph makes me think you are actually saying is \"Poor Quality is Risky\", or perhaps \"A Little Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing\" because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly.\r\n\r\nBy \"essentially complex\" do you mean \"necessarily complex\"?  i.e.  This is the level of complexity that is needed as a minimum, you cannot go any simpler than this?\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"essentially complex\" do you actually mean that the model is complex by nature.  Complexity is often seen as a undesirable, , so complex nature could be a bad thing.\r\n\r\nReading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base.  Am I right in thinking that this is the \"Essentially complex quality model.\"  Since you are presenting it, then I assume it must be a good thing.  The title and introduction don't make this clear.\r\n\r\nAlso, you begin the second paragraph referring to \"some at the SEI.\"  You then refer to \"We\".  Is the \"We\" the people at the SEI, or are you referring to the people ClearSpecs Enterprises? \r\n\r\nI hope you can understand my confusion and can help me clarify my understanding.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\n\r\nGed","created_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z"},{"id":3023,"submission_id":6786,"talk_id":12965,"user":{"name":"David Gelperin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/58dc7fd3fec8a0f1410e81c70809f012?s=500","email":"david@clearspecs.com"},"body":"Sorry for the confusion. \r\n\r\nI changed the title to \"Qualities are Very Complex\" because that is my message.  I am using \"essential complexity\" as Fred Brooks does.  DNA, the London subway, and Einstein's theory of relativity are each more complex than a triangle or benzene molecule.  \r\n\r\n\"Essential complexity\" is neither bad nor good.  It is a scalar characteristic, like weight.  By definition, if I build a model or solve a problem, the essential complexity of the thing being modeled or the problem being solved determines the essential complexity of an accurate model or an effective solution.\r\n\r\nWhile understanding higher levels of essential complexity is very difficult, simplistic understanding can be dangerous.  If the software in a self-driving car is simplistic, people will die needlessly.  \r\n\r\n“A Simplistic Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing” because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly. – Yes   Complexity is often seen as undesirable, [just like too much weight], so complex nature could be a bad thing – No [Human intelligence is not a bad thing, but unnecessary complexity is a bad thing.]  Reading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base. Am I right in thinking that this is the “Essentially complex quality model.” – Yes\r\n\r\nHere is the rewrite:  Qualities are Very Complex\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of a project, you should identify likely project risks.  Quality goals may be among them.  These goals must be defined, achieved, and verified.  We show that current quality models are simplistic and then describe a quality model of sufficient complexity.\r\n\r\nWe highlight the features of a quality knowledge base that outlines over 60 quality attributes, their support and conflict relationships, and their tactics for goal definition, achievement, and verification.  This knowledge base is freely available and enables you to identify your quality goals and strategies at the beginning of a project.  If you don’t use it, you may waste time and increase project risk.\r\n\r\nImprovement suggestions much appreciated.

IMO, a “quality model of sufficient complexity” doesn’t sound very enticing to the agile, framework-oriented developer of today.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with all but the word \"simple\".  The set of quality attributes and some individual attributes like safety and security are NOT simple (just like DNA).  Some attributes have entire books written about them. Their specification, design, and verification is NOT simple.\r\n\r\nI understand that I am \"selling\" complexity (reality?), but the earth is not flat and orbits are not circular.  Simplistic models of quality attributes will never produce predictable quality.\r\n\r\nAs to enticing the Agile crowd, there are many problems.  I have written that \"Agile is a Quality Antipattern\" and \"Fixing Agile\".  \"Pure\" agile is simplistic.  It can work great as long as you ignore quality goals.  These goals don't fit the Agile paradigm because they should be identified and specified early and achieved and verified in every iteration.  In surveys of current Agile practice, over 50% of the responders don't following any coding standards.  These Agile projects build huge quality debt starting from the first increment.

A lot of focus is put on the *initial development* aspect, before the first delivery, and little attention is given to the *maintenance phase* of the software system. With more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models, creating long-lived Internet systems that aren’t forgiving to downtimes or cumbersome data migrations, maintenance becomes much more important and critical to the overall design of the system than the initial development.\r\n\r\nAgile offers a different, *Emergent* method to design software, with small iterations that, when combined with continuous delivery and learning, results in a design that’s much more adaptive to changing requirements. Taken to the extreme, we shorten the initial development phase to a minimum and focus mostly on iterative maintenance steps. \r\n\r\nHowever, the conditions required to facilitate Emergent Design require that the development team refrain from over-engineering and YAGNI violations - two problems that are prevalent in the software industry, especially with less-experienced engineers. Outside-In Development is a methodology that helps us focus on the Semantics rather the Mechanics of our software, protect us from YAGNI violations, and thus facilitate Emergent Design. Practicing TDD helps us implement this methodology in the scope of a commercial software project, by helping us cultivate a Beginner’s Mind towards software design.","notes":"I will start by describing the gap between how engineers usually view software design and how Internet-scale systems actually evolves. I will then make the point that software isn’t like bridges, cars or other “classical” engineering projects. I will use the biological analogy, talking about software as a garden and how we always build on existing system state, and how software engineering is an ongoing, evolving effort. I will claim that a paradigm shift is needed towards wide adoption of Emergent Design.\r\n\r\nNext, I will explain why traditional software engineering training is deleterious to this paradigm shift, with people learning to think about static, rather than evolving, software design, and are taught more about the mechanics of software (design patterns, technology) and less about the semantics (creating the right abstractions). I will discuss Outside-In Development and explain how it helps stick to the YAGNI principle, and how this facilitates Emergent Design. I will explain that it’s hard to adopt outside-in due to the way engineers are trained and how cultivating a Beginner’s Mind helps us put aside these problems and achieve outside-in.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will explain how practicing TDD helps us cultivate the Beginner’s Mind and facilitate outside-in, with test-first serving as the outside user of a system or subsystem, and how the Refactoring phase of TDD helps design emerge.\r\n\r\n### Presentation History:\r\nInitially developed in 2014 as an internal Wix.com tech talk.

First and foremost, I can't actually promise that anything I say is new to the audience of SATURN, although I have delivered this talk in earlier formats at various European conferences, including XP2016 in Edinburgh earlier this year, and got positive feedback.\r\n\r\nOne major difference is that I'm talking about Test-Driven *Design* rather than Test-Driven Development. Many talks and books deal with Test-Driven Development, focusing on the \"how\"s rather than the \"why\"s - how to write unit tests, for instance, rather than \"what's in it for me\". My talk, and to a greater extent my epiphany, has to do with our fallacies as software engineers, their origins, and how TDD, by helping us cultivate a beginner's mind, can aid in getting rid or taming these fallacies, which include YAGNI violation, over-engineering, pattern obsession and so on. \r\n\r\nWhile this talk doesn't relate to software architecture in the common sense (topology, microservices, databasesm etc), it does deal with how adhering to TDD as a methodology is beneficial for software organizations that develop web-scale, long-lived Internet systems, as was our experience at Wix.com.","created_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z"},{"id":2651,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Shai, Thanks for the update!

I don't understand what you mean by \"more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models\" in practice. Do you mean more development organizations are creating their software solutions as SaaS? Is it true for the enterprise? Or do you mean more organizations are using various SaaS solutions, such as dockerhub and github? \r\n\r\n2. I think maintainability is an important quality attribute requirement for software systems in general. If you use patterns and tactics that promote maintainability, I think you are giving attention to the maintenance phase. In the first paragraph, it seems you are saying that BDUF does not focus on maintainability. I don't think that's the problem with BDUF. The problem is that you design beyond what's known at the beginning. If you start coding earlier, initial releases will give you incredible understanding of runtime/maintainability issues that help to drive downstream design in the right direction. \r\n\r\n3. Here's what wikipedia says about Emergent Design: \"With emergent design, a development organization starts delivering functionality and lets the design emerge. Development will take a piece of functionality A and implement it using best practices and proper test coverage and then move on to delivering functionality B. Once B is built, or while it is being built, the organization will look at what A and B have in common and refactor out the commonality, allowing the design to emerge. This process continues as the organization continually delivers functionality.\"\r\nI'm not sure this is your interpretation of emergent design. In any case, it is important to reflect about some points. Is this approach good in all cases? If not, what's the criteria to decide when to use it? Aren't there tradeoffs related to following emergent design? What kinds of design decisions are in the scope of this approach? Does emergent design prevent the use of techniques (such as DDD) that ask you to design beyond the scope of a scrum sprint functionality? \r\n\r\n4. From the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program, I think the title+description don't make it clear what the talk is about. The title makes you think it's about TDD. The description may make you think the talk is about Emergent Design and/or the outside-in development approach. \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6. In the description, consider adding what participants will learn, that is, how do they benefit from this talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"Semantics rather *than* the Mechanics\"\r\n\r\n- \"protect*s* us from YAGNI\"\r\n\r\n- \"and thus facilitate*s* Emergent Design\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z"},{"id":3972,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Shai Yallin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e68285df5c6b2561d0453845b7b2b5ac?s=500","email":"shai.yallin@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Paulo,\r\nRe: 1 - I mean that companies start offering their products as SaaS rather than on-premise. I think this also applies to enterprise, yes - if you look at major software companies, such as HPE - who have traditionally been offering on-prem solutions only.\r\n\r\nRe: 2 - yes, I agree with what you say. But I think that the mere act of *performing* a BDUF will create a mindset that thinks in terms of a deliverable (\"car\") rather than an evolvable (\"garden\").\r\n\r\nRe: 3 - note that I'm not referring to scope, or to sprints. I'm referring to letting design emerge rather than forcing a design that stems from the mind of an architect (and not from evidence). What recently became clearer to me is that most of what I say is applicable mainly to Applications, as defined by Lehman (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman's_laws_of_software_evolution).\r\n\r\nRe: 4 - what I'm trying to say is that TDD is a great way to promote emergent design, by helping the engineer cultivate a beginner's mind.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. I fully agree with Yogeshwar. You should also discuss the challenges and drawbacks of serverless architecture. Software architects need to understand the tradeoffs that come with any design decision. A lot of material we see out there about the newest and brightest idea often only emphasize the benefits. Surely serverless is not the best solution for all cases.\r\n\r\n2. The term serverless is actually quite broad and poorly defined. For example, [Mike Roberts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) associates serverless to the use of MBaaS (more common), or alternatively richer clients (SPA?) talking to services behind an API gateway. Thus, I hope your talk has a clear description of what a serverless architecture is.

Sketching helps with brainstorming ideas, iterating through concepts, and communicating your ideas to others. Whether working individually or in a group, your ability to sketch helps take the abstract ideas out of heads and into the real world. If you’re not comfortable sketching then there is little chance that your ideas will stick with you, your team members, and even your clients. Don’t worry—the confidence you need to put your pen to paper and start to sketch is close at hand! With the addition of a few simple approaches to your daily routine, you too can harness the power of sketching. \r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n- Developers can sketch.\r\n- Understand the benefits of sketching and why it is important for developers\r\n- Learn specific techniques to power up your sketching skills\r\n- See the power of sketching firsthand by taking part in sketching activities\r\n\r\nCome prepared to do fun sketching activities in this hands-on talk so you can experience the power of sketching firsthand. \r\n","notes":"The goal of my talk is to help both designers and non-designers understand the power of sketching. Everyone has great ideas to share and the faster we get them out of our heads and into the physical world the quicker we can move forward. \r\n\r\nAgenda of my talk:\r\n\r\n- Talk about the power of sketching. \r\n- Comparison of two designers and how they approach sketching and what effects that has on their careers. \r\n- Tools needed to sketch. \r\n- Sketching Activities - I have the attendees do a few sketching activities to help them understand the power of sketching firsthand. (This has been a wild success at previous talks.)\r\nAfter each activity, I have the attendees discuss the sketches with each other to help them practice talking about their sketches.\r\n- Close out the talk by showing sketches from my 30-day sketching challenge and how it transformed my sketching skills.\r\n\r\nI want the attendees to understand that the transformation from a little bit or not at all sketching to harnessing the power of sketching is not a long time. All it takes is some consistency and effort.

The presentation is not hands on, where as the workshop is. Many people find that they learn better if they actually play with the tools. Playing with the tools is what happens in This workshop. The workshop will work well if we can get the VM I have to attendees before the workshop. Attendees need to have this setup and runable before the workshop, otherwise it usually takes up to much time during the workshop. If we can get a network share setup that attendees can download the VM, and follow the directions I provide before the workshop then it usually works well. Also having a box of NTFS formatted 16GB USB sticks loaded with my VM, that can be handed out on and/or during the conference or even in the workshop, has worked well as a backup plan.\r\n\r\nThis submission can also be run as a tutorial, which takes less time, due to the non hands on nature, no one has to set anything up other than myself. If run as a tutorial, I just run through the tooling parts as a workshop myself. This way attendees get more of an idea how things fit together than they would if it was just the short presentation.\r\n\r\nNumbers also play a part in what works best. If a large number of people wish to attend, then the presentation works best. If over 20 - 30 developers attend, then usually the workshop turns into more of a tutorial, unless, we are really organised and attendees are fully setup before the tutorial/workshop. I have 4 USB  sticks that I can pass around during the workshop, but this only works if there are 20 or less developers in the class.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, the workshop offers the most, but only if you can support the facilities required and both of us provide excellent comms to people wishing to attend the workshop in the weeks and days leading up to it. My preference is the presentation, as it is less work, but it's your call, I'm happy to run either.\r\n\r\nI have run quite a few training's similar to this before:\r\n\r\nNodeConfEU (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#security-regression-testing-with-zapapi-and-nodegoat-nodeconf-eu) was a similar workshop (45 people in the class), that may have ended up more of a tutorial, but didn't as we had a box of USB sticks loaded and a network share and had good comms with the attendees before the session.\r\n\r\nDevSecCon (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#devseccon-asia-2017-developing-a-high-performance-security-focussed-agile-team-2-hour-workshop) is aiming to host a similar workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, developers/engineers generally get a lot out of this. For me, I generally try not to differentiate to much between devs and architects. An excellent architect should still have their hands on the tools, it's just that they are also expected to be in a lot of other places at the same time. For the architects with less hands on involvement, the tutorial or even presentation style may be best suited to them. In saying that though, if everyone is setup before the workshop, then I can usually hold hands fairly firmly through the hands on content.\r\n\r\nThe content, whether hands on or not, in many cases is quite eye opening, so there are good take aways for all. My last presentation at AgileNZ (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#agilenz2016-agile-security-for-web-developers-50-minute-presentation) which was mostly targeted toward developers, was still well received by the audience which were mostly Product Owners, Managers and Architects. The AgileNZ presentation had quite a bit of the same content as what I've submitted here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high and low level together is what my book series addresses and encourages development teams (PO's, Managers, Architects, Engineers) to grasp and understand. First chapter being 30'000 foot view, which leads into 10,000 foot view, then into some fairly detailed asset identification, risk identification, countermeasure identification, etc... based on Bruce Schneier's Sensible Securitty Model (SSM). The content teaches all people involved in the process of building technical solutions to think outside of their tunnel vision. Architects to think about low level details and Engineers to think holistically, hence the title: \"Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developer\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by clear value proposition? Does the following not provide this:\r\n\"have proven their value in:\r\n(1) Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market)\r\n(2) Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs)\r\n(3) Without descoping\r\nand all while reducing total project cost (fact)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be happy for some assistance to formulate this better for SATURN if you would be keen to help?\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that has clarified most of it?\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z"},{"id":3622,"submission_id":8056,"talk_id":15299,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Kim, thank you for the clarification!

In agile projects, this means being part of every sprint that needs architecturally significant decisions. In order to do this successful, a good collaboration between the technical lead and the architect is necessary. What I've regularly seem in practice, is that both roles are not always present in the same team: some projects might be to small (budget, man days, scope, ...) while many others are organised sub-optimal. One of your review-colleagues also pointed this out.\r\n\r\nBoth roles have some things in common (eg. leadership) and some of the tips I want to provide, should assist in creating this synergy: as a technical lead pay attention to architectural decisions, collaborate on the decision-making process. Get involved. You can see that this requires a different approach with or without a formal architectural role. I too often saw technical leads putting all their focus on \"tools\" and \"frameworks\" and I believe this alone is not enough to deliver successful systems (and sometimes it can be enough). Leadership is about being able to delegate, collaborate (with architects, developers, business people, ... stakeholders). An architect should embrace working with a technical lead, guide him, elevate him. And a technical lead should also embrace working with an architect: support him with technical options, ...\r\n\r\nI strongly believe collaboration will aid both roles to perform better and become better. The roles have both similarities and differences.

However, I'm not so interested in the implementation details.\r\n\r\nI would love to see a talk provide an good, practical overview of the topic for the architect.  This is an area of debate for architects, so I think it is a very relevant field for discussion.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the first addition of \"Software Architecture in Practice\" the statement was made: \"Making a system's user interface clear and easy to use is primarily a matter of getting the details of a user's interaction correct … but these details are not architectural.\"\r\n\r\nIn later editions this position was retracted with a section called \"Usability Mea Culpa (or that’s not Architecture)\" but other architects still disagree.  Consider this blog post that insists that usability is important, but still not architecture: http://enterprise-it-architecture.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/usability-is-not-architecture-quality.html\r\n\r\nAs somebody with a passion for and experience of achieving accessibility, could you explain to architects why this is an important quality attribute and the role that architects play in improving it?\r\n\r\nIf you could include some well defined quality scenarios [1] and relevant architectural tactics [2] that would be very desirable.  The testing approach would be covered by the tactics and you might want to focus on this in particular.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this would be quite a deviation from your current proposal.

I can tell you from my own personal experiences that bad/ lazy service architecture can definitely impact and lead to bad UI. A lot of times, these things are in the name of security or performance and sometimes they can be smoothed over on the front end, but most times they can't. Speaking as a Front-End architect, performance is just as much a part of usability as accessibility is. \r\n\r\nI would agree that implementation of accessibility will not be of any interest to most architects, unless they are front-end like myself.

Agile architecting is a topic of interest as development times continue to shorten.\r\n\r\nCould you explain more about what type of agile development you are addressing? You have mention \"agile software development process\" (lowercase agile) and \"Agile Practices\" (uppercase Agile). There can be differences, and audience members may make incorrect assumptions. Will the talk address how architecting activities relate to some specific Agile methods (for example, sprints) or is it more about architecting in a less strictly defined but still rapidly changing environment?\r\n\r\nIt may be difficult to present all the proposed content in 15 minutes. The abstract describes five topics, some with subtopics. If you need to shorten it, I suggest that the history information (waterfall to iterative to agile) could be trimmed out. That is information audience members can find in other places (for example, on the Web).\r\n\r\nHow you specifically combined architecting tasks and work produces with agile timelines, and how you are able to continually revise the architecture without big tear ups and lost work will be most valuable to audience members. I suggest a focus on those aspects (that is, your topic 3).\r\n\r\nFor which track is this talk proposed? Track 1 or 3 seem applicable.","created_at":"2017-01-18T15:55:40.712Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T15:55:40.712Z"},{"id":3448,"submission_id":8186,"talk_id":15555,"user":{"name":"Babu Samuel","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6e279ebeacbe1385d2663141e1251642?s=500","email":"bsamuel25@gmail.com"},"body":"Thank you for the feedback. Please see below my answers to your questions.\r\n\r\nIn this topic, I was trying to address how architecting activities relate to Agile Software Development (ASD) methods (for example Scrum). In other words  how architects can be effective in iterative, incremental and evolutionary development . I agree that it is difficult to cover the topics I put in my abstract in 15 minutes. So I am thinking of concentrating what you proposed which is mostly on topic 3. So here I will concentrate more on how to continually revise the architecture without big tear ups and lost work or how to avoid design erosion.  \r\n\r\nI think this will fit on Track 1 (how architects can be effective in fast-moving, agile environments)\r\n\r\nSo here is my revised abstract on this topic.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, there is a question central to many discussions surrounding agile approaches to architecting software: In agile process, is the architecture of the system designed up-front, or does it emerge over time as the result of the agile software development process such as Scrum? However, according to the followers of Agile Software Development (ASD) methods, upfront design and evaluation of Software Architecture are likely to consume lot of time and effort without providing a valuable deliverables. The proponents of Software Architecture believe that sound architectural practices cannot be followed using agile approaches. This presentation shows how software architects embrace change by systematically altering design activities with iterative architecture assessment and refactoring.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-20T18:41:13.803Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T18:41:13.803Z"},{"id":3450,"submission_id":8186,"talk_id":15555,"user":{"name":"Anthony Tsakiris","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/646a039dcf3a2c4434f8fdf6c962b902?s=500","email":"adt2@speakeasy.net"},"body":"Thanks for the reply!

Appeal to your largest audience, provide cohesive experiences, and reduce development costs. It is an investment with one of the best returns in all of software. It's simple, cheap and awesome.\r\n\r\nApplication security is fundamental to software from initial design to every line developed. Security should not be an afterthought. Similarly, usability has this same ubiquity throughout the life-cycle of software. The fastest, most secure, most scalable software can end up in the trash because it misses the most important success criteria for any program in the universe - user acceptance. Software architecture profoundly impacts usability. Usability profoundly impacts acceptance. Architects may not choose app colors, error messages, and device layout, but they certainly make choices that enable and constrain designers options that make our software better. Like security is everyone’s responsibility at some level, so is usability at some level.\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees learn? Inclusive design isn’t only usability; it’s recognizing that your user base changes as their social and environmental contexts change. If your user is standing in the sun, waiting for a train in the snow, holding a baby, riding a bus, visiting a library or watching the big game in a sports bar, applications can account for the one type of user that, given a certain context, looks and acts like another type of user. Inclusive design helps developers understand these contexts. It applies these to our implementations to add modalities, flexibility in workflows, and intentional tolerance for user mistakes. Developers will learn to recognize contextual assumptions and apply new, potential contexts to their existing user base so they can serve them best while consequently serving a new, larger user base.

At first glance (and from my previous limited knowledge) I thought it was part of UX.  So while something that architects might have an interest in, probably not something they'd do themselves.  I take your point that it needs to be everyone's business, but what I can't tell is the impact on architecture.  Will you be focusing on how the architecture enables or constrains inclusive design?

In your talk, design is User Interface design if I'm not mistaken. Not a problem, but it would avoid someone the confusion if you explicitly said UI desing somewhere (example: \"Inclusive UI Design\"). \r\n\r\n2) In the Description, it would be useful to qualify app as \"mobile app\" in at least one place. \r\n\r\n3) This sentence is not clear to me: \"inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor.\"  I'm not sure changing the nature of my app is a goal to pursue. What I want primarily is to improve its quality (usability, performance, badwidth utilization, power consumption, portability, maintainability, security, etc.).\r\n\r\nIn the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-04T17:04:42.668Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T17:04:42.668Z"},{"id":3231,"submission_id":7397,"talk_id":14116,"user":{"name":"Jerry Nixon","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6afe42704687605517eadfc5b08920c7?s=500","email":"jnixon@microsoft.com"},"body":"This is really great feedback.

Generally I cover the internals to illustrate why Concourse is a good solution for a specific case within CI/CD, but I can also move more towards a generalist CI/CD strategy talk where Concourse is simple an illustration of a solution to a specific problem.\r\n\r\nA specific example I cover is how testing commits to various microservice repos can be integrated together into a pipeline that eventually deploys software externally, and I show an example Concourse pipeline that illustrates this. I can definitely expand more on the former, and provide a good CI/CD strategy overview in the context of distributed systems, microservices, and container orchestration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback!

The presentation is not hands on, where as the workshop is. Many people find that they learn better if they actually play with the tools. Playing with the tools is what happens in This workshop. The workshop will work well if we can get the VM I have to attendees before the workshop. Attendees need to have this setup and runable before the workshop, otherwise it usually takes up to much time during the workshop. If we can get a network share setup that attendees can download the VM, and follow the directions I provide before the workshop then it usually works well. Also having a box of NTFS formatted 16GB USB sticks loaded with my VM, that can be handed out on and/or during the conference or even in the workshop, has worked well as a backup plan.\r\n\r\nThis submission can also be run as a tutorial, which takes less time, due to the non hands on nature, no one has to set anything up other than myself. If run as a tutorial, I just run through the tooling parts as a workshop myself. This way attendees get more of an idea how things fit together than they would if it was just the short presentation.\r\n\r\nNumbers also play a part in what works best. If a large number of people wish to attend, then the presentation works best. If over 20 - 30 developers attend, then usually the workshop turns into more of a tutorial, unless, we are really organised and attendees are fully setup before the tutorial/workshop. I have 4 USB  sticks that I can pass around during the workshop, but this only works if there are 20 or less developers in the class.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, the workshop offers the most, but only if you can support the facilities required and both of us provide excellent comms to people wishing to attend the workshop in the weeks and days leading up to it. My preference is the presentation, as it is less work, but it's your call, I'm happy to run either.\r\n\r\nI have run quite a few training's similar to this before:\r\n\r\nNodeConfEU (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#security-regression-testing-with-zapapi-and-nodegoat-nodeconf-eu) was a similar workshop (45 people in the class), that may have ended up more of a tutorial, but didn't as we had a box of USB sticks loaded and a network share and had good comms with the attendees before the session.\r\n\r\nDevSecCon (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#devseccon-asia-2017-developing-a-high-performance-security-focussed-agile-team-2-hour-workshop) is aiming to host a similar workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, developers/engineers generally get a lot out of this. For me, I generally try not to differentiate to much between devs and architects. An excellent architect should still have their hands on the tools, it's just that they are also expected to be in a lot of other places at the same time. For the architects with less hands on involvement, the tutorial or even presentation style may be best suited to them. In saying that though, if everyone is setup before the workshop, then I can usually hold hands fairly firmly through the hands on content.\r\n\r\nThe content, whether hands on or not, in many cases is quite eye opening, so there are good take aways for all. My last presentation at AgileNZ (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#agilenz2016-agile-security-for-web-developers-50-minute-presentation) which was mostly targeted toward developers, was still well received by the audience which were mostly Product Owners, Managers and Architects. The AgileNZ presentation had quite a bit of the same content as what I've submitted here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high and low level together is what my book series addresses and encourages development teams (PO's, Managers, Architects, Engineers) to grasp and understand. First chapter being 30'000 foot view, which leads into 10,000 foot view, then into some fairly detailed asset identification, risk identification, countermeasure identification, etc... based on Bruce Schneier's Sensible Securitty Model (SSM). The content teaches all people involved in the process of building technical solutions to think outside of their tunnel vision. Architects to think about low level details and Engineers to think holistically, hence the title: \"Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developer\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by clear value proposition? Does the following not provide this:\r\n\"have proven their value in:\r\n(1) Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market)\r\n(2) Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs)\r\n(3) Without descoping\r\nand all while reducing total project cost (fact)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be happy for some assistance to formulate this better for SATURN if you would be keen to help?\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that has clarified most of it?\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z"},{"id":3622,"submission_id":8056,"talk_id":15299,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Kim, thank you for the clarification!

In the dojos I have setup / ran, teams are building their products while learning new skills and directly applying them to what they are building.  To give you an example, the last team I was with was building an OAuth service to be used by multiple front-ends.  So they were learning OAuth, along with microservices (Spring Boot in this case), while building with drone / gradle, deploying via kubernetes...all done test driven.  We were doing this in the frame of building their product.  For the majority of the people - it was two teams, about a total of 10 developers - these were new skills. So instead of reading a site and trying to apply something or take a course in one topic, we sat and worked directly with teams on how to build 'the right product, the right way.'  Other teams have learned Java (coming from mainframe), mobile development, etc.  I have even ran these with non-technical teams like L&D or marketing.\r\n\r\nSo what goes on?  Learning in the context of building your stuff.\r\n\r\nI am of course biased to a dojo approach - I like the idea of whole teams learning together in their context.  I would offer up that if you just have a single skill that needs to be amplified, a dojo wouldn't be right.  For example, if you just need to understand kafka - then yeah, a dojo might be overkill.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJoel","created_at":"2017-01-27T13:13:25.618Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T13:13:25.618Z"},{"id":3746,"submission_id":8167,"talk_id":15519,"user":{"name":"George Fairbanks","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7617/George-Fairbanks.png","email":"gf@georgefairbanks.com"},"body":"I'm open to the idea that dojo style could be used in software design / architecture, but the abstract doesn't help me understand how that connection.

The SEI should know this and lead a campaign to fix it.\r\n\r\nAgilists believe that requirements “emerge” during iterative development.  They also believe that Big Requirements Up Front (BRUF) is an Agile anti-pattern.  While BRUF may be a poor strategy for gathering functional requirements, it is the best strategy for identifying quality goals.\r\n\r\nMost functional requirements may eventually emerge because of clearer customer understanding.  Unfortunately, most quality goals will not and those that do are unlikely to emerge early.\r\n\r\nInternal quality goals such as code understandability and testability, will never emerge from domain understanding.  Some high-profile external goals such as safety, security, and privacy may emerge, but at unpredictable times.  Others, such as ease of use, reliability, and responsiveness, will emerge if there are gross quality failures.  A focus on functionality will delay emergence of most quality goals.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, waiting for quality goal emergence is a poor idea and unnecessary.  Waiting results in the accumulation of sizable technical debt during early iterations.  Debt piles up because quality support functions, such as exception handlers, are missing everywhere.\r\n\r\nUse of a comprehensive quality model enables quality goals to be identified early.  It also enables the early specification of both quality achievement and quality verification strategies.  Such a quality model is freely available at www.quality-aware.com/q-a-daves-stuff.php.

Performance also impacts the usability and user adoption rate after the system goes live. However, performance issues usually show up during the later phases of the project or during system implementation such as Load / Stress Test and / or User Acceptance Test (UAT) when data volume scales up. The probable cause is a lack of non-functional requirements on performance at an early stage of the architectural design. This presentation is to conceive and show how to salvage a troubled project with performance issues that focuses on performance and storage trade-offs, and how Architecture Analysis Tradeoff Method (ATAM) is used to leverage the performance and storage trade-offs. The specific tailored solution I wanted to share is to move data aggregation and sorting from backend database to Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time and be accessed over http through query parameters. I will also discuss performance concerns from end-to-end in systems the deal with heavy data aggregation and sorting using real-world implementation examples. Perspectives on how to address performance concerns and turn around a troubled project in a very short period of time will also be elaborated.\r\n\r\nIntroduction and Architecture Quality Attributes (5 minutes) \r\nPerformance and Storage Trade-offs by example (15 minutes) \r\nArchitectural Dynamics, Challenges, and Impacts (5 minutes) \r\nQ&A (5 minutes)\r\n","notes":"The take away for this presentation will be the practical techniques to salvage projects with severe system performance issues. This presentation is based on my real-world experiences in salvaging two multiple-million dollar projects in a very short period. Neither project conducted architecture quality attributes workshop (QAW). The performance issues were so severe that the projects were subject to be cancelled. The root of causes were extensive data aggregation with heavy computation and sorting on a low-end databases. One of the two projects simply tried to reuse a simple mobile application architecture with 2 search criteria and less than 100 thousand records on a PostgreSQL to a full blown application with 100 million records with over 20 search criteria. When performance issues appeared at UAT, $2 million dollars were already invested in the project. I will present a quick turnaround options including tailored solutions ranging from increasing hardware / network capacity, database tuning / query optimization, API optimization, to the implementation of Solr or Elasticsearch to address the performance issue. The examples I will use in the presentation will be performance and storage trade-offs that leverage the Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time. The architectural dynamics, challenges, and impacts such as Solr indexing time impact to the existing ETL process and PaaS issues will also be presented.

I updated my Talk Description as follows, but was not able to edit the original description.  Any help I can get from you to revise the original submission?\r\n---------\r\nPerformance is one of the critical architecture quality attributes. The performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a non-functional requirement that is used as an acceptance criteria for almost every project / system. Performance SLA also impacts the usability and user adoption rate after the system goes live. However, performance issues usually show up during the later phases of the project or during system implementation such as Load / Stress Test and / or User Acceptance Test (UAT) when data volume scales up. The probable cause is a lack of defined architecture quality attributes and vague non-functional requirements on performance at the early stage of the project such as architectural design. This presentation is to conceive and show how to salvage a troubled project with performance SLA issues that focuses on performance and storage trade-offs, and how Architecture Analysis Tradeoff Method (ATAM) is used to leverage the performance and storage trade-offs. The specific tailored solution I wanted to share is to move data aggregation and sorting from backed end database to Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time and be access over http through query parameters. I will also discuss detailed issue resolution approaches to address performance concerns from end-to-end, real-world implementation on performance and storage trade-offs to turn the project around in a very short period of time to meet the performance SLA.\r\n\r\nIntroduction and Architecture Quality Attributes?

I think the talk description uses the term SLA inaccurately. SLA is a document that may specify perfomance requirements, among other things. I'd argue that the majority of software systems out there do not have such a document in effect. So, saying \"The performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a non-functional requirement that is used as an acceptance criteria for almost every project / system\" is an overstatement to me. But if you drop the term \"Service Level Agreement (SLA)\", the sentence sounds quite valid. \r\n\r\n2. Likewise, the SLA document doesn't impact usability. It's performance that affects usability. \r\n\r\n3. The talk description uses quite some space to discuss the general importance of performance as a quality attribute requirement. I believe that's not the focus of the talk, but as is the description becomes less interesting, because many SATURN attendees are well aware that performance requirements are important. The title and description could be more specific and clearly indicate what kind of performance optimization is discussed. In other words, I suggest you say in the title and abstract what specific kind of performance solution you'll present. \r\n\r\n4. You say \"The probable cause is a lack of defined architecture quality attributes and vague non-functional requirements on performance at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\" It's not clear to me what is \"defined architecture quality attributes\" versus \" non-functional requirements on performance.\"  Also, I think it would make more sense to say \"at an early stage of the architectural design\" instead of \"at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\"\r\n\r\n5. The phrase \"I will also discuss detailed issue resolution approaches to address performance concerns from end-to-end\"  sounds very general and hence too ambitious. Maybe you should be more specific, such as \"... performance concerns from end-to-end in systems that deal with text search on indexed data sets. \r\n\r\n6. The term \"storage trade-offs\" is not clear. Is is about tradeoffs regarding the choice of infrastructure used for persisting data? Maybe RDBMS vs NoSQL databases? Maybe tradeoffs related to Lucene indexing options? \r\n\r\n7. SATURN attendees are interested in technologies, tools, frameworks that have been used successfully. So, in an unbiased fashion, you could try to mention tools such as profilers and performance monitors that you have used. Learning about the experience of others with such tools may raise the interest in your talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"sorting from back**end database to Solr \"\r\n\r\n- \"and be access*ed* over http\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z"},{"id":3747,"submission_id":8268,"talk_id":15740,"user":{"name":"George Fairbanks","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7617/George-Fairbanks.png","email":"gf@georgefairbanks.com"},"body":"I'm drawn to this talk because of the specifics of the case studies as described in the Notes section.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. Today Software Architecture is taught at many undergrad and graduate academic programs in the US and abroad. Also, there are many professional training classes available. Some are vendor agnostic (such as the SEI courses), others are offered by vendors, such as Microsoft and Oracle. In your presentation, do you consider taking classes on software architecture an effective possible step in the roadmap? \r\n\r\n2. The software architect should also have a clear understanding of quality attributes, such as modifiability, availability, performance, and security. He/she should know how to elicit and document quality attribute requirements, because these requirements are the most important architecture drivers. \r\n\r\n3. The architect should also understand that architecture consists of multiple structures, which are documented in multiple views. He/she should know how to communicate the multi-view architecture effectively. Many times this communication involves diagrams, so the architect should know UML or know how to create and use an informal diagram notation consistently. \r\n\r\n4. A question that could be discussed in your presentation: is there value in pursuing one of the different available software architecture certifications? \r\n\r\n5. The architect should also know how to create, document, and evaluate an architecture. \r\n\r\n6. Years ago people at the SEI software architecture group engaged in a discussion about the duties, skills and knowledge of an architect. One of the results of that discussion is on [this web page](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/research/previousresearch/duties.cfm). It might have useful information for your presentation. \r\n\r\n7. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n8.

Different nodes on different machines try to communicate with each other as well different devices and controllers do. \r\nThese IoT devices can certainly connect through a lot of different ways, but in this talk I focus on cellular connectivity. Obviously, other receptions are always limited to the access point, and also dependent on network and device configurations. Cellular has reception everywhere without any maintenance effort from the customer side, so with telecom access a large-scale investigation is possible. Given the ubiquity of sim based IoT devices, cellular solutions can achieve an unbelievable level of coverage in both space and time for observing any events.\r\nIf we take IoT and wanna use it in a large scale for example in agriculture industry in Africa, we have to built a suitable large architecture. As low-energy network does not exist there and can provide connectivity only on one site, so the communication with the combine on the field will be always insecure. Even SMS can play a role as an intermediate solution and help with device distribution or middleware. GSM network always can be used, even if internet is not available, which makes it reliable and persistent channel for IoT connectivity.\r\nIn my talk I include not only an agriculture, but also e-health, logistic and alarm system cases, with journey map and code demonstration.\r\n\r\nCheers, Karina","created_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z"}]}},{"id":6786,"submission":{"id":6786,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2016-11-30T04:43:58.355Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T21:17:09.133Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVTF4vXmw-c","rating":25.75,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["quality attribute models","essentially complex models","quality goals"],"profile":{"name":"David Gelperin","bio":"David Gelperin is CTO of ClearSpecs Enterprises.

I'm very interested in the topic of software quality, but I'm sorry to say that I'm finding your description a little perplexing.\r\n\r\nThe title is confusing me.  My initial thought was that you were saying \"Software Quality Attributes Considered Harmful.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, reading the introduction paragraph makes me think you are actually saying is \"Poor Quality is Risky\", or perhaps \"A Little Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing\" because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly.\r\n\r\nBy \"essentially complex\" do you mean \"necessarily complex\"?  i.e.  This is the level of complexity that is needed as a minimum, you cannot go any simpler than this?\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"essentially complex\" do you actually mean that the model is complex by nature.  Complexity is often seen as a undesirable, , so complex nature could be a bad thing.\r\n\r\nReading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base.  Am I right in thinking that this is the \"Essentially complex quality model.\"  Since you are presenting it, then I assume it must be a good thing.  The title and introduction don't make this clear.\r\n\r\nAlso, you begin the second paragraph referring to \"some at the SEI.\"  You then refer to \"We\".  Is the \"We\" the people at the SEI, or are you referring to the people ClearSpecs Enterprises? \r\n\r\nI hope you can understand my confusion and can help me clarify my understanding.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\n\r\nGed","created_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z"},{"id":3023,"submission_id":6786,"talk_id":12965,"user":{"name":"David Gelperin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/58dc7fd3fec8a0f1410e81c70809f012?s=500","email":"david@clearspecs.com"},"body":"Sorry for the confusion. \r\n\r\nI changed the title to \"Qualities are Very Complex\" because that is my message.  I am using \"essential complexity\" as Fred Brooks does.  DNA, the London subway, and Einstein's theory of relativity are each more complex than a triangle or benzene molecule.  \r\n\r\n\"Essential complexity\" is neither bad nor good.  It is a scalar characteristic, like weight.  By definition, if I build a model or solve a problem, the essential complexity of the thing being modeled or the problem being solved determines the essential complexity of an accurate model or an effective solution.\r\n\r\nWhile understanding higher levels of essential complexity is very difficult, simplistic understanding can be dangerous.  If the software in a self-driving car is simplistic, people will die needlessly.  \r\n\r\n“A Simplistic Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing” because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly. – Yes   Complexity is often seen as undesirable, [just like too much weight], so complex nature could be a bad thing – No [Human intelligence is not a bad thing, but unnecessary complexity is a bad thing.]  Reading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base.

I think we need techniques that make specification, design, and validation of quality goals simple and practical. IMO, a “quality model of sufficient complexity” doesn’t sound very enticing to the agile, framework-oriented developer of today.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with all but the word \"simple\".  The set of quality attributes and some individual attributes like safety and security are NOT simple (just like DNA).  Some attributes have entire books written about them. Their specification, design, and verification is NOT simple.\r\n\r\nI understand that I am \"selling\" complexity (reality?), but the earth is not flat and orbits are not circular.  Simplistic models of quality attributes will never produce predictable quality.\r\n\r\nAs to enticing the Agile crowd, there are many problems.  I have written that \"Agile is a Quality Antipattern\" and \"Fixing Agile\".  \"Pure\" agile is simplistic.  It can work great as long as you ignore quality goals.  These goals don't fit the Agile paradigm because they should be identified and specified early and achieved and verified in every iteration.  In surveys of current Agile practice, over 50% of the responders don't following any coding standards.  These Agile projects build huge quality debt starting from the first increment.

A lot of focus is put on the *initial development* aspect, before the first delivery, and little attention is given to the *maintenance phase* of the software system. With more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models, creating long-lived Internet systems that aren’t forgiving to downtimes or cumbersome data migrations, maintenance becomes much more important and critical to the overall design of the system than the initial development.\r\n\r\nAgile offers a different, *Emergent* method to design software, with small iterations that, when combined with continuous delivery and learning, results in a design that’s much more adaptive to changing requirements. Taken to the extreme, we shorten the initial development phase to a minimum and focus mostly on iterative maintenance steps. \r\n\r\nHowever, the conditions required to facilitate Emergent Design require that the development team refrain from over-engineering and YAGNI violations - two problems that are prevalent in the software industry, especially with less-experienced engineers. Outside-In Development is a methodology that helps us focus on the Semantics rather the Mechanics of our software, protect us from YAGNI violations, and thus facilitate Emergent Design. Practicing TDD helps us implement this methodology in the scope of a commercial software project, by helping us cultivate a Beginner’s Mind towards software design.","notes":"I will start by describing the gap between how engineers usually view software design and how Internet-scale systems actually evolves. I will then make the point that software isn’t like bridges, cars or other “classical” engineering projects. I will use the biological analogy, talking about software as a garden and how we always build on existing system state, and how software engineering is an ongoing, evolving effort. I will claim that a paradigm shift is needed towards wide adoption of Emergent Design.\r\n\r\nNext, I will explain why traditional software engineering training is deleterious to this paradigm shift, with people learning to think about static, rather than evolving, software design, and are taught more about the mechanics of software (design patterns, technology) and less about the semantics (creating the right abstractions). I will discuss Outside-In Development and explain how it helps stick to the YAGNI principle, and how this facilitates Emergent Design. I will explain that it’s hard to adopt outside-in due to the way engineers are trained and how cultivating a Beginner’s Mind helps us put aside these problems and achieve outside-in.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will explain how practicing TDD helps us cultivate the Beginner’s Mind and facilitate outside-in, with test-first serving as the outside user of a system or subsystem, and how the Refactoring phase of TDD helps design emerge.\r\n\r\n### Presentation History:\r\nInitially developed in 2014 as an internal Wix.com tech talk.

Many talks and books deal with Test-Driven Development, focusing on the \"how\"s rather than the \"why\"s - how to write unit tests, for instance, rather than \"what's in it for me\". My talk, and to a greater extent my epiphany, has to do with our fallacies as software engineers, their origins, and how TDD, by helping us cultivate a beginner's mind, can aid in getting rid or taming these fallacies, which include YAGNI violation, over-engineering, pattern obsession and so on. \r\n\r\nWhile this talk doesn't relate to software architecture in the common sense (topology, microservices, databasesm etc), it does deal with how adhering to TDD as a methodology is beneficial for software organizations that develop web-scale, long-lived Internet systems, as was our experience at Wix.com.","created_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z"},{"id":2651,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Shai, Thanks for the update!

I don't understand what you mean by \"more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models\" in practice. Do you mean more development organizations are creating their software solutions as SaaS? Is it true for the enterprise? Or do you mean more organizations are using various SaaS solutions, such as dockerhub and github? \r\n\r\n2. I think maintainability is an important quality attribute requirement for software systems in general. If you use patterns and tactics that promote maintainability, I think you are giving attention to the maintenance phase. In the first paragraph, it seems you are saying that BDUF does not focus on maintainability. I don't think that's the problem with BDUF. The problem is that you design beyond what's known at the beginning. If you start coding earlier, initial releases will give you incredible understanding of runtime/maintainability issues that help to drive downstream design in the right direction. \r\n\r\n3. Here's what wikipedia says about Emergent Design: \"With emergent design, a development organization starts delivering functionality and lets the design emerge. Development will take a piece of functionality A and implement it using best practices and proper test coverage and then move on to delivering functionality B. Once B is built, or while it is being built, the organization will look at what A and B have in common and refactor out the commonality, allowing the design to emerge. This process continues as the organization continually delivers functionality.\"\r\nI'm not sure this is your interpretation of emergent design. In any case, it is important to reflect about some points. Is this approach good in all cases? If not, what's the criteria to decide when to use it? Aren't there tradeoffs related to following emergent design? What kinds of design decisions are in the scope of this approach? Does emergent design prevent the use of techniques (such as DDD) that ask you to design beyond the scope of a scrum sprint functionality? \r\n\r\n4. From the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program, I think the title+description don't make it clear what the talk is about. The title makes you think it's about TDD. The description may make you think the talk is about Emergent Design and/or the outside-in development approach. \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6. In the description, consider adding what participants will learn, that is, how do they benefit from this talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"Semantics rather *than* the Mechanics\"\r\n\r\n- \"protect*s* us from YAGNI\"\r\n\r\n- \"and thus facilitate*s* Emergent Design\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z"},{"id":3972,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Shai Yallin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e68285df5c6b2561d0453845b7b2b5ac?s=500","email":"shai.yallin@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Paulo,\r\nRe: 1 - I mean that companies start offering their products as SaaS rather than on-premise.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. I fully agree with Yogeshwar. You should also discuss the challenges and drawbacks of serverless architecture. Software architects need to understand the tradeoffs that come with any design decision. A lot of material we see out there about the newest and brightest idea often only emphasize the benefits. Surely serverless is not the best solution for all cases.\r\n\r\n2. The term serverless is actually quite broad and poorly defined. For example, [Mike Roberts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) associates serverless to the use of MBaaS (more common), or alternatively richer clients (SPA?) talking to services behind an API gateway. Thus, I hope your talk has a clear description of what a serverless architecture is. A brief definition of serverless in the talk description would also be helpful to correctly set the expectations of participants looking at the conference program.\r\n\r\n3. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n4. Like Michael, I too see significant overlap with your other submission.

Sketching helps with brainstorming ideas, iterating through concepts, and communicating your ideas to others. Whether working individually or in a group, your ability to sketch helps take the abstract ideas out of heads and into the real world. If you’re not comfortable sketching then there is little chance that your ideas will stick with you, your team members, and even your clients. Don’t worry—the confidence you need to put your pen to paper and start to sketch is close at hand! With the addition of a few simple approaches to your daily routine, you too can harness the power of sketching. \r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n- Developers can sketch.\r\n- Understand the benefits of sketching and why it is important for developers\r\n- Learn specific techniques to power up your sketching skills\r\n- See the power of sketching firsthand by taking part in sketching activities\r\n\r\nCome prepared to do fun sketching activities in this hands-on talk so you can experience the power of sketching firsthand. \r\n","notes":"The goal of my talk is to help both designers and non-designers understand the power of sketching. Everyone has great ideas to share and the faster we get them out of our heads and into the physical world the quicker we can move forward. \r\n\r\nAgenda of my talk:\r\n\r\n- Talk about the power of sketching. \r\n- Comparison of two designers and how they approach sketching and what effects that has on their careers. \r\n- Tools needed to sketch. \r\n- Sketching Activities - I have the attendees do a few sketching activities to help them understand the power of sketching firsthand. (This has been a wild success at previous talks.)\r\nAfter each activity, I have the attendees discuss the sketches with each other to help them practice talking about their sketches.\r\n- Close out the talk by showing sketches from my 30-day sketching challenge and how it transformed my sketching skills.\r\n\r\nI want the attendees to understand that the transformation from a little bit or not at all sketching to harnessing the power of sketching is not a long time. All it takes is some consistency and effort.

In agile projects, this means being part of every sprint that needs architecturally significant decisions. In order to do this successful, a good collaboration between the technical lead and the architect is necessary. What I've regularly seem in practice, is that both roles are not always present in the same team: some projects might be to small (budget, man days, scope, ...) while many others are organised sub-optimal. One of your review-colleagues also pointed this out.\r\n\r\nBoth roles have some things in common (eg. leadership) and some of the tips I want to provide, should assist in creating this synergy: as a technical lead pay attention to architectural decisions, collaborate on the decision-making process. Get involved. You can see that this requires a different approach with or without a formal architectural role. I too often saw technical leads putting all their focus on \"tools\" and \"frameworks\" and I believe this alone is not enough to deliver successful systems (and sometimes it can be enough). Leadership is about being able to delegate, collaborate (with architects, developers, business people, ... stakeholders). An architect should embrace working with a technical lead, guide him, elevate him. And a technical lead should also embrace working with an architect: support him with technical options, ...\r\n\r\nI strongly believe collaboration will aid both roles to perform better and become better. The roles have both similarities and differences. And that's a really good thing.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nBart Blommaerts","created_at":"2017-01-24T08:25:28.238Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T08:25:28.238Z"},{"id":3601,"submission_id":7199,"talk_id":13762,"user":{"name":"Ged Byrne","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef4de37718ebb5c4fc1c2236331ee9d9?s=500","email":"ged.byrne@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Bart,\r\n\r\nThanks for replying.

However, I'm not so interested in the implementation details.\r\n\r\nI would love to see a talk provide an good, practical overview of the topic for the architect.  This is an area of debate for architects, so I think it is a very relevant field for discussion.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the first addition of \"Software Architecture in Practice\" the statement was made: \"Making a system's user interface clear and easy to use is primarily a matter of getting the details of a user's interaction correct … but these details are not architectural.\"\r\n\r\nIn later editions this position was retracted with a section called \"Usability Mea Culpa (or that’s not Architecture)\" but other architects still disagree.  Consider this blog post that insists that usability is important, but still not architecture: http://enterprise-it-architecture.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/usability-is-not-architecture-quality.html\r\n\r\nAs somebody with a passion for and experience of achieving accessibility, could you explain to architects why this is an important quality attribute and the role that architects play in improving it?\r\n\r\nIf you could include some well defined quality scenarios [1] and relevant architectural tactics [2] that would be very desirable.  The testing approach would be covered by the tactics and you might want to focus on this in particular.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this would be quite a deviation from your current proposal.  You may think of something closer to what you already have that will help to convince architects that this is something they need to be interested in.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=4\r\n[2] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=5\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z"},{"id":3640,"submission_id":7723,"talk_id":14675,"user":{"name":"Gerard Cohen","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/3931/GerardKCohen400x400.jpeg","email":"gerardkcohen@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Ged,\r\n\r\nI can understand why architects do not feel that usability, or UI, belongs in the realm of architecture. I can tell you from my own personal experiences that bad/ lazy service architecture can definitely impact and lead to bad UI. A lot of times, these things are in the name of security or performance and sometimes they can be smoothed over on the front end, but most times they can't. Speaking as a Front-End architect, performance is just as much a part of usability as accessibility is. \r\n\r\nI would agree that implementation of accessibility will not be of any interest to most architects, unless they are front-end like myself. But if you are interested in having the discussion of how bad architecture could lead to bad usability, I certainly have a few anecdotes that I could share.","created_at":"2017-01-25T03:33:17.197Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T03:33:17.197Z"},{"id":3644,"submission_id":7723,"talk_id":14675,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"There was a great [talk on globalization last year at SATURN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPabgSykvD8&list=PLSNlEg26NNpy1RjhlISNMRNO1gypYaXHo).

At the same time, it seems that most of web accessibility is related to implementation details - color choice, proper tagging, good naming, navigation orders for JAWS, etc.\r\n\r\nI think the goal for most SATURN attendees would not be to become an accessibility expert, but to learn enough to not make bad trade-offs as Gerard mentioned (e.g. security over accessibility) or at least be aware that trade-offs are happening.  The proposed talk will go into significant detail that I don't think will be of general interest.  I realize that's a little sad since this is an important topic.

An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices","description":"An invisible app? An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices\r\nI know what you're thinking. You want to know what the triple-A app titles already know. It's Inclusive Design, a process to deliver intuitive usability; it is the heart-and-soul of great User Experience and innovative interactions. Your app is in a cosmic battle with the Uninstall button; inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor. Appeal to your largest audience, provide cohesive experiences, and reduce development costs. It is an investment with one of the best returns in all of software. It's simple, cheap and awesome.\r\n\r\nApplication security is fundamental to software from initial design to every line developed. Security should not be an afterthought. Similarly, usability has this same ubiquity throughout the life-cycle of software. The fastest, most secure, most scalable software can end up in the trash because it misses the most important success criteria for any program in the universe - user acceptance. Software architecture profoundly impacts usability. Usability profoundly impacts acceptance. Architects may not choose app colors, error messages, and device layout, but they certainly make choices that enable and constrain designers options that make our software better. Like security is everyone’s responsibility at some level, so is usability at some level.\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees learn? Inclusive design isn’t only usability; it’s recognizing that your user base changes as their social and environmental contexts change. If your user is standing in the sun, waiting for a train in the snow, holding a baby, riding a bus, visiting a library or watching the big game in a sports bar, applications can account for the one type of user that, given a certain context, looks and acts like another type of user. Inclusive design helps developers understand these contexts. It applies these to our implementations to add modalities, flexibility in workflows, and intentional tolerance for user mistakes. Developers will learn to recognize contextual assumptions and apply new, potential contexts to their existing user base so they can serve them best while consequently serving a new, larger user base.

Generally I cover the internals to illustrate why Concourse is a good solution for a specific case within CI/CD, but I can also move more towards a generalist CI/CD strategy talk where Concourse is simple an illustration of a solution to a specific problem.\r\n\r\nA specific example I cover is how testing commits to various microservice repos can be integrated together into a pipeline that eventually deploys software externally, and I show an example Concourse pipeline that illustrates this.

The double proposals leave it up to us to judge what is the best way to get your message across, which may or may not work in your benefit.\r\n\r\nI like the building a team aspect of your talk, architects often double as leads in one way or another, with or without reporting line responsibility.

Now having read both proposals, I'd recommend you to update the 30 min session to a focussed talk with a clear value proposition for architects and lead-developers. Dropping more technical material.

The presentation is not hands on, where as the workshop is. Many people find that they learn better if they actually play with the tools. Playing with the tools is what happens in This workshop. The workshop will work well if we can get the VM I have to attendees before the workshop. Attendees need to have this setup and runable before the workshop, otherwise it usually takes up to much time during the workshop. If we can get a network share setup that attendees can download the VM, and follow the directions I provide before the workshop then it usually works well. Also having a box of NTFS formatted 16GB USB sticks loaded with my VM, that can be handed out on and/or during the conference or even in the workshop, has worked well as a backup plan.\r\n\r\nThis submission can also be run as a tutorial, which takes less time, due to the non hands on nature, no one has to set anything up other than myself. If run as a tutorial, I just run through the tooling parts as a workshop myself. This way attendees get more of an idea how things fit together than they would if it was just the short presentation.\r\n\r\nNumbers also play a part in what works best. If a large number of people wish to attend, then the presentation works best. If over 20 - 30 developers attend, then usually the workshop turns into more of a tutorial, unless, we are really organised and attendees are fully setup before the tutorial/workshop. I have 4 USB  sticks that I can pass around during the workshop, but this only works if there are 20 or less developers in the class.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, the workshop offers the most, but only if you can support the facilities required and both of us provide excellent comms to people wishing to attend the workshop in the weeks and days leading up to it. My preference is the presentation, as it is less work, but it's your call, I'm happy to run either.\r\n\r\nI have run quite a few training's similar to this before:\r\n\r\nNodeConfEU (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#security-regression-testing-with-zapapi-and-nodegoat-nodeconf-eu) was a similar workshop (45 people in the class), that may have ended up more of a tutorial, but didn't as we had a box of USB sticks loaded and a network share and had good comms with the attendees before the session.\r\n\r\nDevSecCon (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#devseccon-asia-2017-developing-a-high-performance-security-focussed-agile-team-2-hour-workshop) is aiming to host a similar workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, developers/engineers generally get a lot out of this. For me, I generally try not to differentiate to much between devs and architects. An excellent architect should still have their hands on the tools, it's just that they are also expected to be in a lot of other places at the same time. For the architects with less hands on involvement, the tutorial or even presentation style may be best suited to them. In saying that though, if everyone is setup before the workshop, then I can usually hold hands fairly firmly through the hands on content.\r\n\r\nThe content, whether hands on or not, in many cases is quite eye opening, so there are good take aways for all. My last presentation at AgileNZ (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#agilenz2016-agile-security-for-web-developers-50-minute-presentation) which was mostly targeted toward developers, was still well received by the audience which were mostly Product Owners, Managers and Architects. The AgileNZ presentation had quite a bit of the same content as what I've submitted here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high and low level together is what my book series addresses and encourages development teams (PO's, Managers, Architects, Engineers) to grasp and understand. First chapter being 30'000 foot view, which leads into 10,000 foot view, then into some fairly detailed asset identification, risk identification, countermeasure identification, etc... based on Bruce Schneier's Sensible Securitty Model (SSM). The content teaches all people involved in the process of building technical solutions to think outside of their tunnel vision. Architects to think about low level details and Engineers to think holistically, hence the title: \"Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developer\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by clear value proposition? Does the following not provide this:\r\n\"have proven their value in:\r\n(1) Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market)\r\n(2) Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs)\r\n(3) Without descoping\r\nand all while reducing total project cost (fact)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be happy for some assistance to formulate this better for SATURN if you would be keen to help?\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that has clarified most of it?\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z"},{"id":3622,"submission_id":8056,"talk_id":15299,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Kim, thank you for the clarification!

In the dojos I have setup / ran, teams are building their products while learning new skills and directly applying them to what they are building.  To give you an example, the last team I was with was building an OAuth service to be used by multiple front-ends.  So they were learning OAuth, along with microservices (Spring Boot in this case), while building with drone / gradle, deploying via kubernetes...all done test driven.  We were doing this in the frame of building their product.  For the majority of the people - it was two teams, about a total of 10 developers - these were new skills. So instead of reading a site and trying to apply something or take a course in one topic, we sat and worked directly with teams on how to build 'the right product, the right way.'  Other teams have learned Java (coming from mainframe), mobile development, etc.  I have even ran these with non-technical teams like L&D or marketing.\r\n\r\nSo what goes on?  Learning in the context of building your stuff.\r\n\r\nI am of course biased to a dojo approach - I like the idea of whole teams learning together in their context.  I would offer up that if you just have a single skill that needs to be amplified, a dojo wouldn't be right.

While BRUF may be a poor strategy for gathering functional requirements, it is the best strategy for identifying quality goals.\r\n\r\nMost functional requirements may eventually emerge because of clearer customer understanding.  Unfortunately, most quality goals will not and those that do are unlikely to emerge early.\r\n\r\nInternal quality goals such as code understandability and testability, will never emerge from domain understanding.  Some high-profile external goals such as safety, security, and privacy may emerge, but at unpredictable times.  Others, such as ease of use, reliability, and responsiveness, will emerge if there are gross quality failures.  A focus on functionality will delay emergence of most quality goals.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, waiting for quality goal emergence is a poor idea and unnecessary.  Waiting results in the accumulation of sizable technical debt during early iterations.  Debt piles up because quality support functions, such as exception handlers, are missing everywhere.\r\n\r\nUse of a comprehensive quality model enables quality goals to be identified early.  It also enables the early specification of both quality achievement and quality verification strategies.  Such a quality model is freely available at www.quality-aware.com/q-a-daves-stuff.php.  The steps to fix Agile and any other incremental development process can be found at www.quality-aware.com.\r\n\r\nSEI publications state that understanding quality goals is an important prerequisite to good architectural decisions.  This suggests that most quality goals should be identified early.  This conflicts with stated Agile beliefs and current Agile practice.  The SEI has been silent on this conflict.  It is time to speak up and campaign for Quality-Aware Agile.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will\r\n•\tExplore current quality practices with attendees\r\n•\tDescribe why Agile and every incremental development process is broken\r\n•\tDescribe the added tasks of Quality-Aware development\r\n•\tSimulate a review and tailoring of the LiteRM quality model in an inspection overview format\r\n•\tExplore objections to using these proposals with attendees","notes":"None","abstract":"Agilists believe that Big Requirements Up Front is an Agile anti-pattern.

This presentation is based on my real-world experiences in salvaging two multiple-million dollar projects in a very short period. Neither project conducted architecture quality attributes workshop (QAW). The performance issues were so severe that the projects were subject to be cancelled. The root of causes were extensive data aggregation with heavy computation and sorting on a low-end databases. One of the two projects simply tried to reuse a simple mobile application architecture with 2 search criteria and less than 100 thousand records on a PostgreSQL to a full blown application with 100 million records with over 20 search criteria. When performance issues appeared at UAT, $2 million dollars were already invested in the project. I will present a quick turnaround options including tailored solutions ranging from increasing hardware / network capacity, database tuning / query optimization, API optimization, to the implementation of Solr or Elasticsearch to address the performance issue. The examples I will use in the presentation will be performance and storage trade-offs that leverage the Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time. The architectural dynamics, challenges, and impacts such as Solr indexing time impact to the existing ETL process and PaaS issues will also be presented.

I think the talk description uses the term SLA inaccurately. SLA is a document that may specify perfomance requirements, among other things. I'd argue that the majority of software systems out there do not have such a document in effect. So, saying \"The performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a non-functional requirement that is used as an acceptance criteria for almost every project / system\" is an overstatement to me. But if you drop the term \"Service Level Agreement (SLA)\", the sentence sounds quite valid. \r\n\r\n2. Likewise, the SLA document doesn't impact usability. It's performance that affects usability. \r\n\r\n3. The talk description uses quite some space to discuss the general importance of performance as a quality attribute requirement. I believe that's not the focus of the talk, but as is the description becomes less interesting, because many SATURN attendees are well aware that performance requirements are important. The title and description could be more specific and clearly indicate what kind of performance optimization is discussed. In other words, I suggest you say in the title and abstract what specific kind of performance solution you'll present. \r\n\r\n4. You say \"The probable cause is a lack of defined architecture quality attributes and vague non-functional requirements on performance at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\" It's not clear to me what is \"defined architecture quality attributes\" versus \" non-functional requirements on performance.\"  Also, I think it would make more sense to say \"at an early stage of the architectural design\" instead of \"at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\"\r\n\r\n5. The phrase \"I will also discuss detailed issue resolution approaches to address performance concerns from end-to-end\"  sounds very general and hence too ambitious. Maybe you should be more specific, such as \"... performance concerns from end-to-end in systems that deal with text search on indexed data sets. \r\n\r\n6. The term \"storage trade-offs\" is not clear. Is is about tradeoffs regarding the choice of infrastructure used for persisting data? Maybe RDBMS vs NoSQL databases? Maybe tradeoffs related to Lucene indexing options? \r\n\r\n7. SATURN attendees are interested in technologies, tools, frameworks that have been used successfully. So, in an unbiased fashion, you could try to mention tools such as profilers and performance monitors that you have used. Learning about the experience of others with such tools may raise the interest in your talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"sorting from back**end database to Solr \"\r\n\r\n- \"and be access*ed* over http\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z"},{"id":3747,"submission_id":8268,"talk_id":15740,"user":{"name":"George Fairbanks","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7617/George-Fairbanks.png","email":"gf@georgefairbanks.com"},"body":"I'm drawn to this talk because of the specifics of the case studies as described in the Notes section.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. Today Software Architecture is taught at many undergrad and graduate academic programs in the US and abroad. Also, there are many professional training classes available. Some are vendor agnostic (such as the SEI courses), others are offered by vendors, such as Microsoft and Oracle. In your presentation, do you consider taking classes on software architecture an effective possible step in the roadmap? \r\n\r\n2. The software architect should also have a clear understanding of quality attributes, such as modifiability, availability, performance, and security. He/she should know how to elicit and document quality attribute requirements, because these requirements are the most important architecture drivers. \r\n\r\n3. The architect should also understand that architecture consists of multiple structures, which are documented in multiple views. He/she should know how to communicate the multi-view architecture effectively. Many times this communication involves diagrams, so the architect should know UML or know how to create and use an informal diagram notation consistently. \r\n\r\n4. A question that could be discussed in your presentation: is there value in pursuing one of the different available software architecture certifications? \r\n\r\n5. The architect should also know how to create, document, and evaluate an architecture. \r\n\r\n6. Years ago people at the SEI software architecture group engaged in a discussion about the duties, skills and knowledge of an architect. One of the results of that discussion is on [this web page](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/research/previousresearch/duties.cfm). It might have useful information for your presentation. \r\n\r\n7. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n8. It would be interesting to see a discussion of what has changed in recent years in the role of architect in the \"digital era\", the era of microservices, containers, and agile development. \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T20:02:45.410Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T20:02:45.410Z"},{"id":3947,"submission_id":7996,"talk_id":15195,"user":{"name":"Pradyumn Sharma","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c5b87d50700eeed460070d11880dc17?s=500","email":"pradyumn.sharma@gmail.com"},"body":"Hello Paulo,\r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestions and inputs. \r\n\r\n1.

Different nodes on different machines try to communicate with each other as well different devices and controllers do. \r\nThese IoT devices can certainly connect through a lot of different ways, but in this talk I focus on cellular connectivity. Obviously, other receptions are always limited to the access point, and also dependent on network and device configurations. Cellular has reception everywhere without any maintenance effort from the customer side, so with telecom access a large-scale investigation is possible. Given the ubiquity of sim based IoT devices, cellular solutions can achieve an unbelievable level of coverage in both space and time for observing any events.\r\nIf we take IoT and wanna use it in a large scale for example in agriculture industry in Africa, we have to built a suitable large architecture. As low-energy network does not exist there and can provide connectivity only on one site, so the communication with the combine on the field will be always insecure. Even SMS can play a role as an intermediate solution and help with device distribution or middleware. GSM network always can be used, even if internet is not available, which makes it reliable and persistent channel for IoT connectivity.\r\nIn my talk I include not only an agriculture, but also e-health, logistic and alarm system cases, with journey map and code demonstration.\r\n\r\nCheers, Karina","created_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z"}]}},{"id":6786,"submission":{"id":6786,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2016-11-30T04:43:58.355Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T21:17:09.133Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVTF4vXmw-c","rating":25.75,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["quality attribute models","essentially complex models","quality goals"],"profile":{"name":"David Gelperin","bio":"David Gelperin is CTO of ClearSpecs Enterprises.

My initial thought was that you were saying \"Software Quality Attributes Considered Harmful.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, reading the introduction paragraph makes me think you are actually saying is \"Poor Quality is Risky\", or perhaps \"A Little Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing\" because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly.\r\n\r\nBy \"essentially complex\" do you mean \"necessarily complex\"?  i.e.  This is the level of complexity that is needed as a minimum, you cannot go any simpler than this?\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"essentially complex\" do you actually mean that the model is complex by nature.  Complexity is often seen as a undesirable, , so complex nature could be a bad thing.\r\n\r\nReading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base.  Am I right in thinking that this is the \"Essentially complex quality model.\"  Since you are presenting it, then I assume it must be a good thing.  The title and introduction don't make this clear.\r\n\r\nAlso, you begin the second paragraph referring to \"some at the SEI.\"  You then refer to \"We\".  Is the \"We\" the people at the SEI, or are you referring to the people ClearSpecs Enterprises? \r\n\r\nI hope you can understand my confusion and can help me clarify my understanding.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\n\r\nGed","created_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z"},{"id":3023,"submission_id":6786,"talk_id":12965,"user":{"name":"David Gelperin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/58dc7fd3fec8a0f1410e81c70809f012?s=500","email":"david@clearspecs.com"},"body":"Sorry for the confusion. \r\n\r\nI changed the title to \"Qualities are Very Complex\" because that is my message.  I am using \"essential complexity\" as Fred Brooks does.  DNA, the London subway, and Einstein's theory of relativity are each more complex than a triangle or benzene molecule.  \r\n\r\n\"Essential complexity\" is neither bad nor good.  It is a scalar characteristic, like weight.  By definition, if I build a model or solve a problem, the essential complexity of the thing being modeled or the problem being solved determines the essential complexity of an accurate model or an effective solution.\r\n\r\nWhile understanding higher levels of essential complexity is very difficult, simplistic understanding can be dangerous.  If the software in a self-driving car is simplistic, people will die needlessly.  \r\n\r\n“A Simplistic Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing” because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly. – Yes   Complexity is often seen as undesirable, [just like too much weight], so complex nature could be a bad thing – No [Human intelligence is not a bad thing, but unnecessary complexity is a bad thing.]  Reading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base. Am I right in thinking that this is the “Essentially complex quality model.” – Yes\r\n\r\nHere is the rewrite:  Qualities are Very Complex\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of a project, you should identify likely project risks.  Quality goals may be among them.  These goals must be defined, achieved, and verified.  We show that current quality models are simplistic and then describe a quality model of sufficient complexity.\r\n\r\nWe highlight the features of a quality knowledge base that outlines over 60 quality attributes, their support and conflict relationships, and their tactics for goal definition, achievement, and verification.  This knowledge base is freely available and enables you to identify your quality goals and strategies at the beginning of a project.  If you don’t use it, you may waste time and increase project risk.\r\n\r\nImprovement suggestions much appreciated.

IMO, a “quality model of sufficient complexity” doesn’t sound very enticing to the agile, framework-oriented developer of today.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with all but the word \"simple\".  The set of quality attributes and some individual attributes like safety and security are NOT simple (just like DNA).  Some attributes have entire books written about them. Their specification, design, and verification is NOT simple.\r\n\r\nI understand that I am \"selling\" complexity (reality?), but the earth is not flat and orbits are not circular.  Simplistic models of quality attributes will never produce predictable quality.\r\n\r\nAs to enticing the Agile crowd, there are many problems.  I have written that \"Agile is a Quality Antipattern\" and \"Fixing Agile\".  \"Pure\" agile is simplistic.  It can work great as long as you ignore quality goals.  These goals don't fit the Agile paradigm because they should be identified and specified early and achieved and verified in every iteration.  In surveys of current Agile practice, over 50% of the responders don't following any coding standards.  These Agile projects build huge quality debt starting from the first increment.

A lot of focus is put on the *initial development* aspect, before the first delivery, and little attention is given to the *maintenance phase* of the software system. With more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models, creating long-lived Internet systems that aren’t forgiving to downtimes or cumbersome data migrations, maintenance becomes much more important and critical to the overall design of the system than the initial development.\r\n\r\nAgile offers a different, *Emergent* method to design software, with small iterations that, when combined with continuous delivery and learning, results in a design that’s much more adaptive to changing requirements. Taken to the extreme, we shorten the initial development phase to a minimum and focus mostly on iterative maintenance steps. \r\n\r\nHowever, the conditions required to facilitate Emergent Design require that the development team refrain from over-engineering and YAGNI violations - two problems that are prevalent in the software industry, especially with less-experienced engineers. Outside-In Development is a methodology that helps us focus on the Semantics rather the Mechanics of our software, protect us from YAGNI violations, and thus facilitate Emergent Design. Practicing TDD helps us implement this methodology in the scope of a commercial software project, by helping us cultivate a Beginner’s Mind towards software design.","notes":"I will start by describing the gap between how engineers usually view software design and how Internet-scale systems actually evolves. I will then make the point that software isn’t like bridges, cars or other “classical” engineering projects. I will use the biological analogy, talking about software as a garden and how we always build on existing system state, and how software engineering is an ongoing, evolving effort. I will claim that a paradigm shift is needed towards wide adoption of Emergent Design.\r\n\r\nNext, I will explain why traditional software engineering training is deleterious to this paradigm shift, with people learning to think about static, rather than evolving, software design, and are taught more about the mechanics of software (design patterns, technology) and less about the semantics (creating the right abstractions). I will discuss Outside-In Development and explain how it helps stick to the YAGNI principle, and how this facilitates Emergent Design. I will explain that it’s hard to adopt outside-in due to the way engineers are trained and how cultivating a Beginner’s Mind helps us put aside these problems and achieve outside-in.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will explain how practicing TDD helps us cultivate the Beginner’s Mind and facilitate outside-in, with test-first serving as the outside user of a system or subsystem, and how the Refactoring phase of TDD helps design emerge.\r\n\r\n### Presentation History:\r\nInitially developed in 2014 as an internal Wix.com tech talk.

First and foremost, I can't actually promise that anything I say is new to the audience of SATURN, although I have delivered this talk in earlier formats at various European conferences, including XP2016 in Edinburgh earlier this year, and got positive feedback.\r\n\r\nOne major difference is that I'm talking about Test-Driven *Design* rather than Test-Driven Development. Many talks and books deal with Test-Driven Development, focusing on the \"how\"s rather than the \"why\"s - how to write unit tests, for instance, rather than \"what's in it for me\". My talk, and to a greater extent my epiphany, has to do with our fallacies as software engineers, their origins, and how TDD, by helping us cultivate a beginner's mind, can aid in getting rid or taming these fallacies, which include YAGNI violation, over-engineering, pattern obsession and so on. \r\n\r\nWhile this talk doesn't relate to software architecture in the common sense (topology, microservices, databasesm etc), it does deal with how adhering to TDD as a methodology is beneficial for software organizations that develop web-scale, long-lived Internet systems, as was our experience at Wix.com.","created_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z"},{"id":2651,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Shai, Thanks for the update!

I don't understand what you mean by \"more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models\" in practice. Do you mean more development organizations are creating their software solutions as SaaS? Is it true for the enterprise? Or do you mean more organizations are using various SaaS solutions, such as dockerhub and github? \r\n\r\n2. I think maintainability is an important quality attribute requirement for software systems in general. If you use patterns and tactics that promote maintainability, I think you are giving attention to the maintenance phase. In the first paragraph, it seems you are saying that BDUF does not focus on maintainability. I don't think that's the problem with BDUF. The problem is that you design beyond what's known at the beginning. If you start coding earlier, initial releases will give you incredible understanding of runtime/maintainability issues that help to drive downstream design in the right direction. \r\n\r\n3. Here's what wikipedia says about Emergent Design: \"With emergent design, a development organization starts delivering functionality and lets the design emerge. Development will take a piece of functionality A and implement it using best practices and proper test coverage and then move on to delivering functionality B. Once B is built, or while it is being built, the organization will look at what A and B have in common and refactor out the commonality, allowing the design to emerge. This process continues as the organization continually delivers functionality.\"\r\nI'm not sure this is your interpretation of emergent design. In any case, it is important to reflect about some points. Is this approach good in all cases? If not, what's the criteria to decide when to use it? Aren't there tradeoffs related to following emergent design? What kinds of design decisions are in the scope of this approach? Does emergent design prevent the use of techniques (such as DDD) that ask you to design beyond the scope of a scrum sprint functionality? \r\n\r\n4. From the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program, I think the title+description don't make it clear what the talk is about. The title makes you think it's about TDD. The description may make you think the talk is about Emergent Design and/or the outside-in development approach. \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6. In the description, consider adding what participants will learn, that is, how do they benefit from this talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"Semantics rather *than* the Mechanics\"\r\n\r\n- \"protect*s* us from YAGNI\"\r\n\r\n- \"and thus facilitate*s* Emergent Design\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z"},{"id":3972,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Shai Yallin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e68285df5c6b2561d0453845b7b2b5ac?s=500","email":"shai.yallin@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Paulo,\r\nRe: 1 - I mean that companies start offering their products as SaaS rather than on-premise. I think this also applies to enterprise, yes - if you look at major software companies, such as HPE - who have traditionally been offering on-prem solutions only.\r\n\r\nRe: 2 - yes, I agree with what you say. But I think that the mere act of *performing* a BDUF will create a mindset that thinks in terms of a deliverable (\"car\") rather than an evolvable (\"garden\").\r\n\r\nRe: 3 - note that I'm not referring to scope, or to sprints. I'm referring to letting design emerge rather than forcing a design that stems from the mind of an architect (and not from evidence). What recently became clearer to me is that most of what I say is applicable mainly to Applications, as defined by Lehman (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman's_laws_of_software_evolution).\r\n\r\nRe: 4 - what I'm trying to say is that TDD is a great way to promote emergent design, by helping the engineer cultivate a beginner's mind.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. I fully agree with Yogeshwar. You should also discuss the challenges and drawbacks of serverless architecture. Software architects need to understand the tradeoffs that come with any design decision. A lot of material we see out there about the newest and brightest idea often only emphasize the benefits. Surely serverless is not the best solution for all cases.\r\n\r\n2. The term serverless is actually quite broad and poorly defined. For example, [Mike Roberts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) associates serverless to the use of MBaaS (more common), or alternatively richer clients (SPA?) talking to services behind an API gateway. Thus, I hope your talk has a clear description of what a serverless architecture is.

Sketching helps with brainstorming ideas, iterating through concepts, and communicating your ideas to others. Whether working individually or in a group, your ability to sketch helps take the abstract ideas out of heads and into the real world. If you’re not comfortable sketching then there is little chance that your ideas will stick with you, your team members, and even your clients. Don’t worry—the confidence you need to put your pen to paper and start to sketch is close at hand! With the addition of a few simple approaches to your daily routine, you too can harness the power of sketching. \r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n- Developers can sketch.\r\n- Understand the benefits of sketching and why it is important for developers\r\n- Learn specific techniques to power up your sketching skills\r\n- See the power of sketching firsthand by taking part in sketching activities\r\n\r\nCome prepared to do fun sketching activities in this hands-on talk so you can experience the power of sketching firsthand. \r\n","notes":"The goal of my talk is to help both designers and non-designers understand the power of sketching. Everyone has great ideas to share and the faster we get them out of our heads and into the physical world the quicker we can move forward. \r\n\r\nAgenda of my talk:\r\n\r\n- Talk about the power of sketching. \r\n- Comparison of two designers and how they approach sketching and what effects that has on their careers. \r\n- Tools needed to sketch. \r\n- Sketching Activities - I have the attendees do a few sketching activities to help them understand the power of sketching firsthand. (This has been a wild success at previous talks.)\r\nAfter each activity, I have the attendees discuss the sketches with each other to help them practice talking about their sketches.\r\n- Close out the talk by showing sketches from my 30-day sketching challenge and how it transformed my sketching skills.\r\n\r\nI want the attendees to understand that the transformation from a little bit or not at all sketching to harnessing the power of sketching is not a long time. All it takes is some consistency and effort. I want to leave them inspired and pumped up to start sketching.\r\n","abstract":"The power of sketching lies in using sketching to ideate, iterate, and communicate our ideas.

Is that the area the topic is going top focus.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to split the talk on roles and responsibilities of the technical lead without the interviewing aspects, as that would allow better focus for the limited time. I am also concerned about the 15-minute time window.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2017/call.cfm","created_at":"2017-01-04T04:36:03.379Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T04:36:03.379Z"},{"id":3035,"submission_id":7199,"talk_id":13762,"user":{"name":"Bart Blommaerts","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5e68e9bdd514eefaaeb93d13f9eb0c06?s=500","email":"daggieken@hotmail.com"},"body":"Hello Yogeshwar,\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback.

In agile projects, this means being part of every sprint that needs architecturally significant decisions. In order to do this successful, a good collaboration between the technical lead and the architect is necessary. What I've regularly seem in practice, is that both roles are not always present in the same team: some projects might be to small (budget, man days, scope, ...) while many others are organised sub-optimal. One of your review-colleagues also pointed this out.\r\n\r\nBoth roles have some things in common (eg. leadership) and some of the tips I want to provide, should assist in creating this synergy: as a technical lead pay attention to architectural decisions, collaborate on the decision-making process. Get involved. You can see that this requires a different approach with or without a formal architectural role. I too often saw technical leads putting all their focus on \"tools\" and \"frameworks\" and I believe this alone is not enough to deliver successful systems (and sometimes it can be enough). Leadership is about being able to delegate, collaborate (with architects, developers, business people, ... stakeholders). An architect should embrace working with a technical lead, guide him, elevate him. And a technical lead should also embrace working with an architect: support him with technical options, ...\r\n\r\nI strongly believe collaboration will aid both roles to perform better and become better. The roles have both similarities and differences. And that's a really good thing.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nBart Blommaerts","created_at":"2017-01-24T08:25:28.238Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T08:25:28.238Z"},{"id":3601,"submission_id":7199,"talk_id":13762,"user":{"name":"Ged Byrne","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef4de37718ebb5c4fc1c2236331ee9d9?s=500","email":"ged.byrne@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Bart,\r\n\r\nThanks for replying.

However, I'm not so interested in the implementation details.\r\n\r\nI would love to see a talk provide an good, practical overview of the topic for the architect.  This is an area of debate for architects, so I think it is a very relevant field for discussion.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the first addition of \"Software Architecture in Practice\" the statement was made: \"Making a system's user interface clear and easy to use is primarily a matter of getting the details of a user's interaction correct … but these details are not architectural.\"\r\n\r\nIn later editions this position was retracted with a section called \"Usability Mea Culpa (or that’s not Architecture)\" but other architects still disagree.  Consider this blog post that insists that usability is important, but still not architecture: http://enterprise-it-architecture.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/usability-is-not-architecture-quality.html\r\n\r\nAs somebody with a passion for and experience of achieving accessibility, could you explain to architects why this is an important quality attribute and the role that architects play in improving it?\r\n\r\nIf you could include some well defined quality scenarios [1] and relevant architectural tactics [2] that would be very desirable.  The testing approach would be covered by the tactics and you might want to focus on this in particular.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this would be quite a deviation from your current proposal.  You may think of something closer to what you already have that will help to convince architects that this is something they need to be interested in.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=4\r\n[2] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=5\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z"},{"id":3640,"submission_id":7723,"talk_id":14675,"user":{"name":"Gerard Cohen","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/3931/GerardKCohen400x400.jpeg","email":"gerardkcohen@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Ged,\r\n\r\nI can understand why architects do not feel that usability, or UI, belongs in the realm of architecture. I can tell you from my own personal experiences that bad/ lazy service architecture can definitely impact and lead to bad UI. A lot of times, these things are in the name of security or performance and sometimes they can be smoothed over on the front end, but most times they can't. Speaking as a Front-End architect, performance is just as much a part of usability as accessibility is. \r\n\r\nI would agree that implementation of accessibility will not be of any interest to most architects, unless they are front-end like myself.

I like the idea of talks that try to find connections between architecture design and UX design.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through some accessibility training I do think there are architectural concerns and many of the trade-offs Gerard mentioned come to bear.  At the same time, it seems that most of web accessibility is related to implementation details - color choice, proper tagging, good naming, navigation orders for JAWS, etc.\r\n\r\nI think the goal for most SATURN attendees would not be to become an accessibility expert, but to learn enough to not make bad trade-offs as Gerard mentioned (e.g. security over accessibility) or at least be aware that trade-offs are happening.

Also there is an importance of supporting evolution and change to a software-intensive system, and the practical implications of creating a change-ready system. The ability to adapt these changes is driven by two factors, Architecture and Agile Practices. This presentation shows some of the techniques an architect can use to be effective in the fast moving agile environments.\r\n1.\tA hybrid form combining both explicit and emergent architectural techniques. This approach explains\r\n\t      (i) How alignment is the part of architectural work where an architect makes sure that the solution fits its mission?\r\n\t      (ii) How distilling the direction of change, and designing the domain essence are explicit architectural activities?\r\n\t      (iii) How creating the detailed structure, and designing the domain essence can be done in an emergent way\r\n2.\tTrace the history of software development practices from waterfall phases through iterative design to agile techniques.

Agile architecting is a topic of interest as development times continue to shorten.\r\n\r\nCould you explain more about what type of agile development you are addressing? You have mention \"agile software development process\" (lowercase agile) and \"Agile Practices\" (uppercase Agile). There can be differences, and audience members may make incorrect assumptions. Will the talk address how architecting activities relate to some specific Agile methods (for example, sprints) or is it more about architecting in a less strictly defined but still rapidly changing environment?\r\n\r\nIt may be difficult to present all the proposed content in 15 minutes. The abstract describes five topics, some with subtopics. If you need to shorten it, I suggest that the history information (waterfall to iterative to agile) could be trimmed out. That is information audience members can find in other places (for example, on the Web).\r\n\r\nHow you specifically combined architecting tasks and work produces with agile timelines, and how you are able to continually revise the architecture without big tear ups and lost work will be most valuable to audience members. I suggest a focus on those aspects (that is, your topic 3).\r\n\r\nFor which track is this talk proposed? Track 1 or 3 seem applicable.","created_at":"2017-01-18T15:55:40.712Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T15:55:40.712Z"},{"id":3448,"submission_id":8186,"talk_id":15555,"user":{"name":"Babu Samuel","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6e279ebeacbe1385d2663141e1251642?s=500","email":"bsamuel25@gmail.com"},"body":"Thank you for the feedback. Please see below my answers to your questions.\r\n\r\nIn this topic, I was trying to address how architecting activities relate to Agile Software Development (ASD) methods (for example Scrum).

So I am thinking of concentrating what you proposed which is mostly on topic 3. So here I will concentrate more on how to continually revise the architecture without big tear ups and lost work or how to avoid design erosion.  \r\n\r\nI think this will fit on Track 1 (how architects can be effective in fast-moving, agile environments)\r\n\r\nSo here is my revised abstract on this topic.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, there is a question central to many discussions surrounding agile approaches to architecting software: In agile process, is the architecture of the system designed up-front, or does it emerge over time as the result of the agile software development process such as Scrum? However, according to the followers of Agile Software Development (ASD) methods, upfront design and evaluation of Software Architecture are likely to consume lot of time and effort without providing a valuable deliverables. The proponents of Software Architecture believe that sound architectural practices cannot be followed using agile approaches. This presentation shows how software architects embrace change by systematically altering design activities with iterative architecture assessment and refactoring.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-20T18:41:13.803Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T18:41:13.803Z"},{"id":3450,"submission_id":8186,"talk_id":15555,"user":{"name":"Anthony Tsakiris","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/646a039dcf3a2c4434f8fdf6c962b902?s=500","email":"adt2@speakeasy.net"},"body":"Thanks for the reply!

An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices","description":"An invisible app? An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices\r\nI know what you're thinking. You want to know what the triple-A app titles already know. It's Inclusive Design, a process to deliver intuitive usability; it is the heart-and-soul of great User Experience and innovative interactions. Your app is in a cosmic battle with the Uninstall button; inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor. Appeal to your largest audience, provide cohesive experiences, and reduce development costs. It is an investment with one of the best returns in all of software. It's simple, cheap and awesome.\r\n\r\nApplication security is fundamental to software from initial design to every line developed. Security should not be an afterthought. Similarly, usability has this same ubiquity throughout the life-cycle of software. The fastest, most secure, most scalable software can end up in the trash because it misses the most important success criteria for any program in the universe - user acceptance. Software architecture profoundly impacts usability. Usability profoundly impacts acceptance. Architects may not choose app colors, error messages, and device layout, but they certainly make choices that enable and constrain designers options that make our software better. Like security is everyone’s responsibility at some level, so is usability at some level.\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees learn? Inclusive design isn’t only usability; it’s recognizing that your user base changes as their social and environmental contexts change. If your user is standing in the sun, waiting for a train in the snow, holding a baby, riding a bus, visiting a library or watching the big game in a sports bar, applications can account for the one type of user that, given a certain context, looks and acts like another type of user. Inclusive design helps developers understand these contexts. It applies these to our implementations to add modalities, flexibility in workflows, and intentional tolerance for user mistakes. Developers will learn to recognize contextual assumptions and apply new, potential contexts to their existing user base so they can serve them best while consequently serving a new, larger user base. ","notes":"This is a 90 minute talk.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the talk includes:\r\n1. Introduction to basic user types\r\n2. Introduction to core user contexts\r\n3.

At first glance (and from my previous limited knowledge) I thought it was part of UX.  So while something that architects might have an interest in, probably not something they'd do themselves.  I take your point that it needs to be everyone's business, but what I can't tell is the impact on architecture.  Will you be focusing on how the architecture enables or constrains inclusive design?

In your talk, design is User Interface design if I'm not mistaken. Not a problem, but it would avoid someone the confusion if you explicitly said UI desing somewhere (example: \"Inclusive UI Design\"). \r\n\r\n2) In the Description, it would be useful to qualify app as \"mobile app\" in at least one place. \r\n\r\n3) This sentence is not clear to me: \"inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor.\"  I'm not sure changing the nature of my app is a goal to pursue.

CI and build pipeline design is certainly an important issue, especially with more and more teams moving to distributed systems such as microservices.

Generally I cover the internals to illustrate why Concourse is a good solution for a specific case within CI/CD, but I can also move more towards a generalist CI/CD strategy talk where Concourse is simple an illustration of a solution to a specific problem.\r\n\r\nA specific example I cover is how testing commits to various microservice repos can be integrated together into a pipeline that eventually deploys software externally, and I show an example Concourse pipeline that illustrates this. I can definitely expand more on the former, and provide a good CI/CD strategy overview in the context of distributed systems, microservices, and container orchestration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback!

The presentation is not hands on, where as the workshop is. Many people find that they learn better if they actually play with the tools. Playing with the tools is what happens in This workshop. The workshop will work well if we can get the VM I have to attendees before the workshop. Attendees need to have this setup and runable before the workshop, otherwise it usually takes up to much time during the workshop. If we can get a network share setup that attendees can download the VM, and follow the directions I provide before the workshop then it usually works well. Also having a box of NTFS formatted 16GB USB sticks loaded with my VM, that can be handed out on and/or during the conference or even in the workshop, has worked well as a backup plan.\r\n\r\nThis submission can also be run as a tutorial, which takes less time, due to the non hands on nature, no one has to set anything up other than myself. If run as a tutorial, I just run through the tooling parts as a workshop myself. This way attendees get more of an idea how things fit together than they would if it was just the short presentation.\r\n\r\nNumbers also play a part in what works best. If a large number of people wish to attend, then the presentation works best. If over 20 - 30 developers attend, then usually the workshop turns into more of a tutorial, unless, we are really organised and attendees are fully setup before the tutorial/workshop. I have 4 USB  sticks that I can pass around during the workshop, but this only works if there are 20 or less developers in the class.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, the workshop offers the most, but only if you can support the facilities required and both of us provide excellent comms to people wishing to attend the workshop in the weeks and days leading up to it. My preference is the presentation, as it is less work, but it's your call, I'm happy to run either.\r\n\r\nI have run quite a few training's similar to this before:\r\n\r\nNodeConfEU (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#security-regression-testing-with-zapapi-and-nodegoat-nodeconf-eu) was a similar workshop (45 people in the class), that may have ended up more of a tutorial, but didn't as we had a box of USB sticks loaded and a network share and had good comms with the attendees before the session.\r\n\r\nDevSecCon (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#devseccon-asia-2017-developing-a-high-performance-security-focussed-agile-team-2-hour-workshop) is aiming to host a similar workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, developers/engineers generally get a lot out of this. For me, I generally try not to differentiate to much between devs and architects. An excellent architect should still have their hands on the tools, it's just that they are also expected to be in a lot of other places at the same time. For the architects with less hands on involvement, the tutorial or even presentation style may be best suited to them. In saying that though, if everyone is setup before the workshop, then I can usually hold hands fairly firmly through the hands on content.\r\n\r\nThe content, whether hands on or not, in many cases is quite eye opening, so there are good take aways for all. My last presentation at AgileNZ (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#agilenz2016-agile-security-for-web-developers-50-minute-presentation) which was mostly targeted toward developers, was still well received by the audience which were mostly Product Owners, Managers and Architects. The AgileNZ presentation had quite a bit of the same content as what I've submitted here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high and low level together is what my book series addresses and encourages development teams (PO's, Managers, Architects, Engineers) to grasp and understand. First chapter being 30'000 foot view, which leads into 10,000 foot view, then into some fairly detailed asset identification, risk identification, countermeasure identification, etc... based on Bruce Schneier's Sensible Securitty Model (SSM). The content teaches all people involved in the process of building technical solutions to think outside of their tunnel vision. Architects to think about low level details and Engineers to think holistically, hence the title: \"Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developer\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by clear value proposition? Does the following not provide this:\r\n\"have proven their value in:\r\n(1) Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market)\r\n(2) Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs)\r\n(3) Without descoping\r\nand all while reducing total project cost (fact)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be happy for some assistance to formulate this better for SATURN if you would be keen to help?\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that has clarified most of it?\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z"},{"id":3622,"submission_id":8056,"talk_id":15299,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Kim, thank you for the clarification!

In the dojos I have setup / ran, teams are building their products while learning new skills and directly applying them to what they are building.  To give you an example, the last team I was with was building an OAuth service to be used by multiple front-ends.  So they were learning OAuth, along with microservices (Spring Boot in this case), while building with drone / gradle, deploying via kubernetes...all done test driven.  We were doing this in the frame of building their product.  For the majority of the people - it was two teams, about a total of 10 developers - these were new skills. So instead of reading a site and trying to apply something or take a course in one topic, we sat and worked directly with teams on how to build 'the right product, the right way.'  Other teams have learned Java (coming from mainframe), mobile development, etc.  I have even ran these with non-technical teams like L&D or marketing.\r\n\r\nSo what goes on?  Learning in the context of building your stuff.\r\n\r\nI am of course biased to a dojo approach - I like the idea of whole teams learning together in their context.  I would offer up that if you just have a single skill that needs to be amplified, a dojo wouldn't be right.  For example, if you just need to understand kafka - then yeah, a dojo might be overkill.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJoel","created_at":"2017-01-27T13:13:25.618Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T13:13:25.618Z"},{"id":3746,"submission_id":8167,"talk_id":15519,"user":{"name":"George Fairbanks","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7617/George-Fairbanks.png","email":"gf@georgefairbanks.com"},"body":"I'm open to the idea that dojo style could be used in software design / architecture, but the abstract doesn't help me understand how that connection.

The SEI should know this and lead a campaign to fix it.\r\n\r\nAgilists believe that requirements “emerge” during iterative development.  They also believe that Big Requirements Up Front (BRUF) is an Agile anti-pattern.  While BRUF may be a poor strategy for gathering functional requirements, it is the best strategy for identifying quality goals.\r\n\r\nMost functional requirements may eventually emerge because of clearer customer understanding.  Unfortunately, most quality goals will not and those that do are unlikely to emerge early.\r\n\r\nInternal quality goals such as code understandability and testability, will never emerge from domain understanding.  Some high-profile external goals such as safety, security, and privacy may emerge, but at unpredictable times.  Others, such as ease of use, reliability, and responsiveness, will emerge if there are gross quality failures.  A focus on functionality will delay emergence of most quality goals.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, waiting for quality goal emergence is a poor idea and unnecessary.  Waiting results in the accumulation of sizable technical debt during early iterations.  Debt piles up because quality support functions, such as exception handlers, are missing everywhere.\r\n\r\nUse of a comprehensive quality model enables quality goals to be identified early.  It also enables the early specification of both quality achievement and quality verification strategies.  Such a quality model is freely available at www.quality-aware.com/q-a-daves-stuff.php.

Performance also impacts the usability and user adoption rate after the system goes live. However, performance issues usually show up during the later phases of the project or during system implementation such as Load / Stress Test and / or User Acceptance Test (UAT) when data volume scales up. The probable cause is a lack of non-functional requirements on performance at an early stage of the architectural design. This presentation is to conceive and show how to salvage a troubled project with performance issues that focuses on performance and storage trade-offs, and how Architecture Analysis Tradeoff Method (ATAM) is used to leverage the performance and storage trade-offs. The specific tailored solution I wanted to share is to move data aggregation and sorting from backend database to Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time and be accessed over http through query parameters. I will also discuss performance concerns from end-to-end in systems the deal with heavy data aggregation and sorting using real-world implementation examples. Perspectives on how to address performance concerns and turn around a troubled project in a very short period of time will also be elaborated.\r\n\r\nIntroduction and Architecture Quality Attributes (5 minutes) \r\nPerformance and Storage Trade-offs by example (15 minutes) \r\nArchitectural Dynamics, Challenges, and Impacts (5 minutes) \r\nQ&A (5 minutes)\r\n","notes":"The take away for this presentation will be the practical techniques to salvage projects with severe system performance issues. This presentation is based on my real-world experiences in salvaging two multiple-million dollar projects in a very short period. Neither project conducted architecture quality attributes workshop (QAW). The performance issues were so severe that the projects were subject to be cancelled. The root of causes were extensive data aggregation with heavy computation and sorting on a low-end databases. One of the two projects simply tried to reuse a simple mobile application architecture with 2 search criteria and less than 100 thousand records on a PostgreSQL to a full blown application with 100 million records with over 20 search criteria. When performance issues appeared at UAT, $2 million dollars were already invested in the project. I will present a quick turnaround options including tailored solutions ranging from increasing hardware / network capacity, database tuning / query optimization, API optimization, to the implementation of Solr or Elasticsearch to address the performance issue. The examples I will use in the presentation will be performance and storage trade-offs that leverage the Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time. The architectural dynamics, challenges, and impacts such as Solr indexing time impact to the existing ETL process and PaaS issues will also be presented.

The author applies accepted practices (for example, QAW, ATAM, UAT) during a turn-around of stranded projects. Finally, the talk would give practical guidance on the suitability of various database technologies for two projects the author worked on.\r\n\r\nThe good and to improve:\r\nThe author correctly points out the importance of designing for important quality attributes up-front and gives concrete examples of the potential cost of failing to do so. While a real world story could engage the audience, we should expect most SATURN attendees to already be aware of these risks.\r\n\r\nConcrete guidance on dealing with performance issues could be of interest to the SATURN community. The proposal does not tell us how the ‘tailored solutions’ used may generalise to other software systems that the audience works on.

I updated my Talk Description as follows, but was not able to edit the original description.  Any help I can get from you to revise the original submission?\r\n---------\r\nPerformance is one of the critical architecture quality attributes. The performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a non-functional requirement that is used as an acceptance criteria for almost every project / system. Performance SLA also impacts the usability and user adoption rate after the system goes live. However, performance issues usually show up during the later phases of the project or during system implementation such as Load / Stress Test and / or User Acceptance Test (UAT) when data volume scales up. The probable cause is a lack of defined architecture quality attributes and vague non-functional requirements on performance at the early stage of the project such as architectural design. This presentation is to conceive and show how to salvage a troubled project with performance SLA issues that focuses on performance and storage trade-offs, and how Architecture Analysis Tradeoff Method (ATAM) is used to leverage the performance and storage trade-offs. The specific tailored solution I wanted to share is to move data aggregation and sorting from backed end database to Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time and be access over http through query parameters. I will also discuss detailed issue resolution approaches to address performance concerns from end-to-end, real-world implementation on performance and storage trade-offs to turn the project around in a very short period of time to meet the performance SLA.\r\n\r\nIntroduction and Architecture Quality Attributes?

I think the talk description uses the term SLA inaccurately. SLA is a document that may specify perfomance requirements, among other things. I'd argue that the majority of software systems out there do not have such a document in effect. So, saying \"The performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a non-functional requirement that is used as an acceptance criteria for almost every project / system\" is an overstatement to me. But if you drop the term \"Service Level Agreement (SLA)\", the sentence sounds quite valid. \r\n\r\n2. Likewise, the SLA document doesn't impact usability. It's performance that affects usability. \r\n\r\n3. The talk description uses quite some space to discuss the general importance of performance as a quality attribute requirement. I believe that's not the focus of the talk, but as is the description becomes less interesting, because many SATURN attendees are well aware that performance requirements are important. The title and description could be more specific and clearly indicate what kind of performance optimization is discussed. In other words, I suggest you say in the title and abstract what specific kind of performance solution you'll present. \r\n\r\n4. You say \"The probable cause is a lack of defined architecture quality attributes and vague non-functional requirements on performance at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\" It's not clear to me what is \"defined architecture quality attributes\" versus \" non-functional requirements on performance.\"  Also, I think it would make more sense to say \"at an early stage of the architectural design\" instead of \"at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\"\r\n\r\n5. The phrase \"I will also discuss detailed issue resolution approaches to address performance concerns from end-to-end\"  sounds very general and hence too ambitious. Maybe you should be more specific, such as \"... performance concerns from end-to-end in systems that deal with text search on indexed data sets. \r\n\r\n6. The term \"storage trade-offs\" is not clear. Is is about tradeoffs regarding the choice of infrastructure used for persisting data? Maybe RDBMS vs NoSQL databases? Maybe tradeoffs related to Lucene indexing options? \r\n\r\n7. SATURN attendees are interested in technologies, tools, frameworks that have been used successfully. So, in an unbiased fashion, you could try to mention tools such as profilers and performance monitors that you have used. Learning about the experience of others with such tools may raise the interest in your talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"sorting from back**end database to Solr \"\r\n\r\n- \"and be access*ed* over http\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z"},{"id":3747,"submission_id":8268,"talk_id":15740,"user":{"name":"George Fairbanks","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7617/George-Fairbanks.png","email":"gf@georgefairbanks.com"},"body":"I'm drawn to this talk because of the specifics of the case studies as described in the Notes section.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. Today Software Architecture is taught at many undergrad and graduate academic programs in the US and abroad. Also, there are many professional training classes available. Some are vendor agnostic (such as the SEI courses), others are offered by vendors, such as Microsoft and Oracle. In your presentation, do you consider taking classes on software architecture an effective possible step in the roadmap? \r\n\r\n2. The software architect should also have a clear understanding of quality attributes, such as modifiability, availability, performance, and security. He/she should know how to elicit and document quality attribute requirements, because these requirements are the most important architecture drivers. \r\n\r\n3. The architect should also understand that architecture consists of multiple structures, which are documented in multiple views. He/she should know how to communicate the multi-view architecture effectively. Many times this communication involves diagrams, so the architect should know UML or know how to create and use an informal diagram notation consistently. \r\n\r\n4. A question that could be discussed in your presentation: is there value in pursuing one of the different available software architecture certifications? \r\n\r\n5. The architect should also know how to create, document, and evaluate an architecture. \r\n\r\n6. Years ago people at the SEI software architecture group engaged in a discussion about the duties, skills and knowledge of an architect. One of the results of that discussion is on [this web page](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/research/previousresearch/duties.cfm). It might have useful information for your presentation. \r\n\r\n7. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n8.

Different nodes on different machines try to communicate with each other as well different devices and controllers do. \r\nThese IoT devices can certainly connect through a lot of different ways, but in this talk I focus on cellular connectivity. Obviously, other receptions are always limited to the access point, and also dependent on network and device configurations. Cellular has reception everywhere without any maintenance effort from the customer side, so with telecom access a large-scale investigation is possible. Given the ubiquity of sim based IoT devices, cellular solutions can achieve an unbelievable level of coverage in both space and time for observing any events.\r\nIf we take IoT and wanna use it in a large scale for example in agriculture industry in Africa, we have to built a suitable large architecture. As low-energy network does not exist there and can provide connectivity only on one site, so the communication with the combine on the field will be always insecure. Even SMS can play a role as an intermediate solution and help with device distribution or middleware. GSM network always can be used, even if internet is not available, which makes it reliable and persistent channel for IoT connectivity.\r\nIn my talk I include not only an agriculture, but also e-health, logistic and alarm system cases, with journey map and code demonstration.\r\n\r\nCheers, Karina","created_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z"}]}},{"id":6786,"submission":{"id":6786,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2016-11-30T04:43:58.355Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T21:17:09.133Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVTF4vXmw-c","rating":25.75,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["quality attribute models","essentially complex models","quality goals"],"profile":{"name":"David Gelperin","bio":"David Gelperin is CTO of ClearSpecs Enterprises.

I'm very interested in the topic of software quality, but I'm sorry to say that I'm finding your description a little perplexing.\r\n\r\nThe title is confusing me.  My initial thought was that you were saying \"Software Quality Attributes Considered Harmful.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, reading the introduction paragraph makes me think you are actually saying is \"Poor Quality is Risky\", or perhaps \"A Little Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing\" because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly.\r\n\r\nBy \"essentially complex\" do you mean \"necessarily complex\"?  i.e.  This is the level of complexity that is needed as a minimum, you cannot go any simpler than this?\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"essentially complex\" do you actually mean that the model is complex by nature.  Complexity is often seen as a undesirable, , so complex nature could be a bad thing.\r\n\r\nReading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base.  Am I right in thinking that this is the \"Essentially complex quality model.\"  Since you are presenting it, then I assume it must be a good thing.  The title and introduction don't make this clear.\r\n\r\nAlso, you begin the second paragraph referring to \"some at the SEI.\"  You then refer to \"We\".

I am using \"essential complexity\" as Fred Brooks does.  DNA, the London subway, and Einstein's theory of relativity are each more complex than a triangle or benzene molecule.  \r\n\r\n\"Essential complexity\" is neither bad nor good.  It is a scalar characteristic, like weight.  By definition, if I build a model or solve a problem, the essential complexity of the thing being modeled or the problem being solved determines the essential complexity of an accurate model or an effective solution.\r\n\r\nWhile understanding higher levels of essential complexity is very difficult, simplistic understanding can be dangerous.  If the software in a self-driving car is simplistic, people will die needlessly.  \r\n\r\n“A Simplistic Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing” because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly. – Yes   Complexity is often seen as undesirable, [just like too much weight], so complex nature could be a bad thing – No [Human intelligence is not a bad thing, but unnecessary complexity is a bad thing.]  Reading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base.

IMO, a “quality model of sufficient complexity” doesn’t sound very enticing to the agile, framework-oriented developer of today.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with all but the word \"simple\".  The set of quality attributes and some individual attributes like safety and security are NOT simple (just like DNA).  Some attributes have entire books written about them. Their specification, design, and verification is NOT simple.\r\n\r\nI understand that I am \"selling\" complexity (reality?), but the earth is not flat and orbits are not circular.  Simplistic models of quality attributes will never produce predictable quality.\r\n\r\nAs to enticing the Agile crowd, there are many problems.  I have written that \"Agile is a Quality Antipattern\" and \"Fixing Agile\".  \"Pure\" agile is simplistic.  It can work great as long as you ignore quality goals.  These goals don't fit the Agile paradigm because they should be identified and specified early and achieved and verified in every iteration.  In surveys of current Agile practice, over 50% of the responders don't following any coding standards.  These Agile projects build huge quality debt starting from the first increment.

A lot of focus is put on the *initial development* aspect, before the first delivery, and little attention is given to the *maintenance phase* of the software system. With more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models, creating long-lived Internet systems that aren’t forgiving to downtimes or cumbersome data migrations, maintenance becomes much more important and critical to the overall design of the system than the initial development.\r\n\r\nAgile offers a different, *Emergent* method to design software, with small iterations that, when combined with continuous delivery and learning, results in a design that’s much more adaptive to changing requirements. Taken to the extreme, we shorten the initial development phase to a minimum and focus mostly on iterative maintenance steps. \r\n\r\nHowever, the conditions required to facilitate Emergent Design require that the development team refrain from over-engineering and YAGNI violations - two problems that are prevalent in the software industry, especially with less-experienced engineers. Outside-In Development is a methodology that helps us focus on the Semantics rather the Mechanics of our software, protect us from YAGNI violations, and thus facilitate Emergent Design. Practicing TDD helps us implement this methodology in the scope of a commercial software project, by helping us cultivate a Beginner’s Mind towards software design.","notes":"I will start by describing the gap between how engineers usually view software design and how Internet-scale systems actually evolves. I will then make the point that software isn’t like bridges, cars or other “classical” engineering projects. I will use the biological analogy, talking about software as a garden and how we always build on existing system state, and how software engineering is an ongoing, evolving effort. I will claim that a paradigm shift is needed towards wide adoption of Emergent Design.\r\n\r\nNext, I will explain why traditional software engineering training is deleterious to this paradigm shift, with people learning to think about static, rather than evolving, software design, and are taught more about the mechanics of software (design patterns, technology) and less about the semantics (creating the right abstractions). I will discuss Outside-In Development and explain how it helps stick to the YAGNI principle, and how this facilitates Emergent Design. I will explain that it’s hard to adopt outside-in due to the way engineers are trained and how cultivating a Beginner’s Mind helps us put aside these problems and achieve outside-in.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will explain how practicing TDD helps us cultivate the Beginner’s Mind and facilitate outside-in, with test-first serving as the outside user of a system or subsystem, and how the Refactoring phase of TDD helps design emerge.\r\n\r\n### Presentation History:\r\nInitially developed in 2014 as an internal Wix.com tech talk.

My talk, and to a greater extent my epiphany, has to do with our fallacies as software engineers, their origins, and how TDD, by helping us cultivate a beginner's mind, can aid in getting rid or taming these fallacies, which include YAGNI violation, over-engineering, pattern obsession and so on. \r\n\r\nWhile this talk doesn't relate to software architecture in the common sense (topology, microservices, databasesm etc), it does deal with how adhering to TDD as a methodology is beneficial for software organizations that develop web-scale, long-lived Internet systems, as was our experience at Wix.com.","created_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z"},{"id":2651,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Shai, Thanks for the update!

I don't understand what you mean by \"more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models\" in practice. Do you mean more development organizations are creating their software solutions as SaaS? Is it true for the enterprise? Or do you mean more organizations are using various SaaS solutions, such as dockerhub and github? \r\n\r\n2. I think maintainability is an important quality attribute requirement for software systems in general. If you use patterns and tactics that promote maintainability, I think you are giving attention to the maintenance phase. In the first paragraph, it seems you are saying that BDUF does not focus on maintainability. I don't think that's the problem with BDUF. The problem is that you design beyond what's known at the beginning. If you start coding earlier, initial releases will give you incredible understanding of runtime/maintainability issues that help to drive downstream design in the right direction. \r\n\r\n3. Here's what wikipedia says about Emergent Design: \"With emergent design, a development organization starts delivering functionality and lets the design emerge. Development will take a piece of functionality A and implement it using best practices and proper test coverage and then move on to delivering functionality B. Once B is built, or while it is being built, the organization will look at what A and B have in common and refactor out the commonality, allowing the design to emerge. This process continues as the organization continually delivers functionality.\"\r\nI'm not sure this is your interpretation of emergent design. In any case, it is important to reflect about some points. Is this approach good in all cases? If not, what's the criteria to decide when to use it? Aren't there tradeoffs related to following emergent design? What kinds of design decisions are in the scope of this approach? Does emergent design prevent the use of techniques (such as DDD) that ask you to design beyond the scope of a scrum sprint functionality? \r\n\r\n4. From the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program, I think the title+description don't make it clear what the talk is about. The title makes you think it's about TDD. The description may make you think the talk is about Emergent Design and/or the outside-in development approach. \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6. In the description, consider adding what participants will learn, that is, how do they benefit from this talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"Semantics rather *than* the Mechanics\"\r\n\r\n- \"protect*s* us from YAGNI\"\r\n\r\n- \"and thus facilitate*s* Emergent Design\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z"},{"id":3972,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Shai Yallin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e68285df5c6b2561d0453845b7b2b5ac?s=500","email":"shai.yallin@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Paulo,\r\nRe: 1 - I mean that companies start offering their products as SaaS rather than on-premise.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. I fully agree with Yogeshwar. You should also discuss the challenges and drawbacks of serverless architecture. Software architects need to understand the tradeoffs that come with any design decision. A lot of material we see out there about the newest and brightest idea often only emphasize the benefits. Surely serverless is not the best solution for all cases.\r\n\r\n2. The term serverless is actually quite broad and poorly defined. For example, [Mike Roberts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) associates serverless to the use of MBaaS (more common), or alternatively richer clients (SPA?) talking to services behind an API gateway. Thus, I hope your talk has a clear description of what a serverless architecture is. A brief definition of serverless in the talk description would also be helpful to correctly set the expectations of participants looking at the conference program.\r\n\r\n3. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n4. Like Michael, I too see significant overlap with your other submission.

Sketching helps with brainstorming ideas, iterating through concepts, and communicating your ideas to others.

If you’re not comfortable sketching then there is little chance that your ideas will stick with you, your team members, and even your clients.

Since I don't have a full grasp of the software architecture domain I would start off by getting architects to understand the power of sketching, which is using sketching for ideation, iteration, and communication of ideas. The sketching activities are designed to show them how little time it takes to sketch and that anyone can sketch. After each activity, I ask the attendees to show their sketches to a person next to them to practice using sketching to communicate.\r\n\r\nDevelopers can then take this knowledge and firsthand experience and apply it to their workflow/processes the very next day. \r\n\r\nTo make a stronger connection with the conference topic I can add a specific software architecture sketching activity.

In agile projects, this means being part of every sprint that needs architecturally significant decisions. In order to do this successful, a good collaboration between the technical lead and the architect is necessary. What I've regularly seem in practice, is that both roles are not always present in the same team: some projects might be to small (budget, man days, scope, ...) while many others are organised sub-optimal. One of your review-colleagues also pointed this out.\r\n\r\nBoth roles have some things in common (eg. leadership) and some of the tips I want to provide, should assist in creating this synergy: as a technical lead pay attention to architectural decisions, collaborate on the decision-making process. Get involved. You can see that this requires a different approach with or without a formal architectural role. I too often saw technical leads putting all their focus on \"tools\" and \"frameworks\" and I believe this alone is not enough to deliver successful systems (and sometimes it can be enough). Leadership is about being able to delegate, collaborate (with architects, developers, business people, ... stakeholders). An architect should embrace working with a technical lead, guide him, elevate him. And a technical lead should also embrace working with an architect: support him with technical options, ...\r\n\r\nI strongly believe collaboration will aid both roles to perform better and become better.

However, I'm not so interested in the implementation details.\r\n\r\nI would love to see a talk provide an good, practical overview of the topic for the architect.  This is an area of debate for architects, so I think it is a very relevant field for discussion.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the first addition of \"Software Architecture in Practice\" the statement was made: \"Making a system's user interface clear and easy to use is primarily a matter of getting the details of a user's interaction correct … but these details are not architectural.\"\r\n\r\nIn later editions this position was retracted with a section called \"Usability Mea Culpa (or that’s not Architecture)\" but other architects still disagree.  Consider this blog post that insists that usability is important, but still not architecture: http://enterprise-it-architecture.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/usability-is-not-architecture-quality.html\r\n\r\nAs somebody with a passion for and experience of achieving accessibility, could you explain to architects why this is an important quality attribute and the role that architects play in improving it?\r\n\r\nIf you could include some well defined quality scenarios [1] and relevant architectural tactics [2] that would be very desirable.  The testing approach would be covered by the tactics and you might want to focus on this in particular.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this would be quite a deviation from your current proposal.  You may think of something closer to what you already have that will help to convince architects that this is something they need to be interested in.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=4\r\n[2] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=5\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z"},{"id":3640,"submission_id":7723,"talk_id":14675,"user":{"name":"Gerard Cohen","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/3931/GerardKCohen400x400.jpeg","email":"gerardkcohen@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Ged,\r\n\r\nI can understand why architects do not feel that usability, or UI, belongs in the realm of architecture. I can tell you from my own personal experiences that bad/ lazy service architecture can definitely impact and lead to bad UI. A lot of times, these things are in the name of security or performance and sometimes they can be smoothed over on the front end, but most times they can't. Speaking as a Front-End architect, performance is just as much a part of usability as accessibility is. \r\n\r\nI would agree that implementation of accessibility will not be of any interest to most architects, unless they are front-end like myself. But if you are interested in having the discussion of how bad architecture could lead to bad usability, I certainly have a few anecdotes that I could share.","created_at":"2017-01-25T03:33:17.197Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T03:33:17.197Z"},{"id":3644,"submission_id":7723,"talk_id":14675,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"There was a great [talk on globalization last year at SATURN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPabgSykvD8&list=PLSNlEg26NNpy1RjhlISNMRNO1gypYaXHo).

At the same time, it seems that most of web accessibility is related to implementation details - color choice, proper tagging, good naming, navigation orders for JAWS, etc.\r\n\r\nI think the goal for most SATURN attendees would not be to become an accessibility expert, but to learn enough to not make bad trade-offs as Gerard mentioned (e.g. security over accessibility) or at least be aware that trade-offs are happening.  The proposed talk will go into significant detail that I don't think will be of general interest.  I realize that's a little sad since this is an important topic.

Agile architecting is a topic of interest as development times continue to shorten.\r\n\r\nCould you explain more about what type of agile development you are addressing?

The proponents of Software Architecture believe that sound architectural practices cannot be followed using agile approaches. This presentation shows how software architects embrace change by systematically altering design activities with iterative architecture assessment and refactoring.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-20T18:41:13.803Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T18:41:13.803Z"},{"id":3450,"submission_id":8186,"talk_id":15555,"user":{"name":"Anthony Tsakiris","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/646a039dcf3a2c4434f8fdf6c962b902?s=500","email":"adt2@speakeasy.net"},"body":"Thanks for the reply!

An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices","description":"An invisible app? An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices\r\nI know what you're thinking. You want to know what the triple-A app titles already know. It's Inclusive Design, a process to deliver intuitive usability; it is the heart-and-soul of great User Experience and innovative interactions. Your app is in a cosmic battle with the Uninstall button; inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor. Appeal to your largest audience, provide cohesive experiences, and reduce development costs. It is an investment with one of the best returns in all of software. It's simple, cheap and awesome.\r\n\r\nApplication security is fundamental to software from initial design to every line developed. Security should not be an afterthought. Similarly, usability has this same ubiquity throughout the life-cycle of software. The fastest, most secure, most scalable software can end up in the trash because it misses the most important success criteria for any program in the universe - user acceptance. Software architecture profoundly impacts usability. Usability profoundly impacts acceptance. Architects may not choose app colors, error messages, and device layout, but they certainly make choices that enable and constrain designers options that make our software better. Like security is everyone’s responsibility at some level, so is usability at some level.\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees learn? Inclusive design isn’t only usability; it’s recognizing that your user base changes as their social and environmental contexts change. If your user is standing in the sun, waiting for a train in the snow, holding a baby, riding a bus, visiting a library or watching the big game in a sports bar, applications can account for the one type of user that, given a certain context, looks and acts like another type of user. Inclusive design helps developers understand these contexts. It applies these to our implementations to add modalities, flexibility in workflows, and intentional tolerance for user mistakes. Developers will learn to recognize contextual assumptions and apply new, potential contexts to their existing user base so they can serve them best while consequently serving a new, larger user base. ","notes":"This is a 90 minute talk.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the talk includes:\r\n1. Introduction to basic user types\r\n2. Introduction to core user contexts\r\n3.

In your talk, design is User Interface design if I'm not mistaken. Not a problem, but it would avoid someone the confusion if you explicitly said UI desing somewhere (example: \"Inclusive UI Design\"). \r\n\r\n2) In the Description, it would be useful to qualify app as \"mobile app\" in at least one place. \r\n\r\n3) This sentence is not clear to me: \"inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor.\"  I'm not sure changing the nature of my app is a goal to pursue. What I want primarily is to improve its quality (usability, performance, badwidth utilization, power consumption, portability, maintainability, security, etc.).\r\n\r\nIn the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-04T17:04:42.668Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T17:04:42.668Z"},{"id":3231,"submission_id":7397,"talk_id":14116,"user":{"name":"Jerry Nixon","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6afe42704687605517eadfc5b08920c7?s=500","email":"jnixon@microsoft.com"},"body":"This is really great feedback. Consider security. It is fundamental to software from initial design to every line developed. Security is not an afterthought. Similarly, usability has this ubiquity throughout the life-cycle of software. The fastest, most secure, most scalable software can end up in the trash because it misses the most important success criteria for any program in the universe - user acceptance. Software architecture profoundly impacts usability. Usability profoundly impacts acceptance. Though architects may not choose app colors, error messages, and device layout, they certainly make choices that enable or constrain designers and the options they might employ. Like security is everyone's responsibility, so is usability. Inclusive design, on the other hand isn't only about usability; it's about recognizing that your user base changes as their social and environmental contexts change. If your user is standing in the sun, waiting for a train in the snow, holding a baby, riding a bus, visiting a library or watching the big game in a sports bar, applications can account for the one type of user given a certain context looks and acts like another type of user. Inclusive design helps developers understand these contexts and apply them to the implementation of their software for to add more modalities, flexibility in workflows, and intentional tolerance for user mistakes.

The double proposals leave it up to us to judge what is the best way to get your message across, which may or may not work in your benefit.\r\n\r\nI like the building a team aspect of your talk, architects often double as leads in one way or another, with or without reporting line responsibility. It seems that you have delivered or intend to deliver this material at developer oriented conferences. We usually see some (lead) developers at SATURN, but please clarify whom your presentation will work for or how it will work for different groups.\r\n\r\nYour outline confuses as it is up-high (team-building) and down in the details (hands-on penetration testing). Now having read both proposals, I'd recommend you to update the 30 min session to a focussed talk with a clear value proposition for architects and lead-developers. Dropping more technical material. Think about your audience and what they need, looking at previous SATURN conference programs gives you an idea of what the reviewers think our audience likes.\r\n\r\nGood luck with generating publicity around your book!\r\nThijmen","created_at":"2017-01-23T19:18:23.938Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T19:18:23.938Z"},{"id":3577,"submission_id":8056,"talk_id":15299,"user":{"name":"Kim Carter","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3d048d750886711537e12649d0b305c1?s=500","email":"Kim.Carter@binarymist.net"},"body":"This submission is a tutorial or workshop. \"Secrets of a High Performance Security Focussed Agile Team\" is a 25-30 minute presentation.\r\n\r\nBoth of the two submissions work well, it depends mostly on how much time you can allow. The presentation is not hands on, where as the workshop is. Many people find that they learn better if they actually play with the tools. Playing with the tools is what happens in This workshop. The workshop will work well if we can get the VM I have to attendees before the workshop. Attendees need to have this setup and runable before the workshop, otherwise it usually takes up to much time during the workshop. If we can get a network share setup that attendees can download the VM, and follow the directions I provide before the workshop then it usually works well. Also having a box of NTFS formatted 16GB USB sticks loaded with my VM, that can be handed out on and/or during the conference or even in the workshop, has worked well as a backup plan.\r\n\r\nThis submission can also be run as a tutorial, which takes less time, due to the non hands on nature, no one has to set anything up other than myself. If run as a tutorial, I just run through the tooling parts as a workshop myself. This way attendees get more of an idea how things fit together than they would if it was just the short presentation.\r\n\r\nNumbers also play a part in what works best. If a large number of people wish to attend, then the presentation works best. If over 20 - 30 developers attend, then usually the workshop turns into more of a tutorial, unless, we are really organised and attendees are fully setup before the tutorial/workshop. I have 4 USB  sticks that I can pass around during the workshop, but this only works if there are 20 or less developers in the class.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, the workshop offers the most, but only if you can support the facilities required and both of us provide excellent comms to people wishing to attend the workshop in the weeks and days leading up to it. My preference is the presentation, as it is less work, but it's your call, I'm happy to run either.\r\n\r\nI have run quite a few training's similar to this before:\r\n\r\nNodeConfEU (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#security-regression-testing-with-zapapi-and-nodegoat-nodeconf-eu) was a similar workshop (45 people in the class), that may have ended up more of a tutorial, but didn't as we had a box of USB sticks loaded and a network share and had good comms with the attendees before the session.\r\n\r\nDevSecCon (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#devseccon-asia-2017-developing-a-high-performance-security-focussed-agile-team-2-hour-workshop) is aiming to host a similar workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, developers/engineers generally get a lot out of this. For me, I generally try not to differentiate to much between devs and architects. An excellent architect should still have their hands on the tools, it's just that they are also expected to be in a lot of other places at the same time. For the architects with less hands on involvement, the tutorial or even presentation style may be best suited to them. In saying that though, if everyone is setup before the workshop, then I can usually hold hands fairly firmly through the hands on content.\r\n\r\nThe content, whether hands on or not, in many cases is quite eye opening, so there are good take aways for all. My last presentation at AgileNZ (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#agilenz2016-agile-security-for-web-developers-50-minute-presentation) which was mostly targeted toward developers, was still well received by the audience which were mostly Product Owners, Managers and Architects. The AgileNZ presentation had quite a bit of the same content as what I've submitted here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high and low level together is what my book series addresses and encourages development teams (PO's, Managers, Architects, Engineers) to grasp and understand. First chapter being 30'000 foot view, which leads into 10,000 foot view, then into some fairly detailed asset identification, risk identification, countermeasure identification, etc... based on Bruce Schneier's Sensible Securitty Model (SSM). The content teaches all people involved in the process of building technical solutions to think outside of their tunnel vision. Architects to think about low level details and Engineers to think holistically, hence the title: \"Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developer\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by clear value proposition? Does the following not provide this:\r\n\"have proven their value in:\r\n(1) Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market)\r\n(2) Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs)\r\n(3) Without descoping\r\nand all while reducing total project cost (fact)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be happy for some assistance to formulate this better for SATURN if you would be keen to help?\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that has clarified most of it?\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z"},{"id":3622,"submission_id":8056,"talk_id":15299,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Kim, thank you for the clarification!

In the dojos I have setup / ran, teams are building their products while learning new skills and directly applying them to what they are building.  To give you an example, the last team I was with was building an OAuth service to be used by multiple front-ends.  So they were learning OAuth, along with microservices (Spring Boot in this case), while building with drone / gradle, deploying via kubernetes...all done test driven.  We were doing this in the frame of building their product.  For the majority of the people - it was two teams, about a total of 10 developers - these were new skills. So instead of reading a site and trying to apply something or take a course in one topic, we sat and worked directly with teams on how to build 'the right product, the right way.'  Other teams have learned Java (coming from mainframe), mobile development, etc.  I have even ran these with non-technical teams like L&D or marketing.\r\n\r\nSo what goes on?  Learning in the context of building your stuff.\r\n\r\nI am of course biased to a dojo approach - I like the idea of whole teams learning together in their context.  I would offer up that if you just have a single skill that needs to be amplified, a dojo wouldn't be right.  For example, if you just need to understand kafka - then yeah, a dojo might be overkill.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJoel","created_at":"2017-01-27T13:13:25.618Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T13:13:25.618Z"},{"id":3746,"submission_id":8167,"talk_id":15519,"user":{"name":"George Fairbanks","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7617/George-Fairbanks.png","email":"gf@georgefairbanks.com"},"body":"I'm open to the idea that dojo style could be used in software design / architecture, but the abstract doesn't help me understand how that connection.

The SEI should know this and lead a campaign to fix it.\r\n\r\nAgilists believe that requirements “emerge” during iterative development.  They also believe that Big Requirements Up Front (BRUF) is an Agile anti-pattern.  While BRUF may be a poor strategy for gathering functional requirements, it is the best strategy for identifying quality goals.\r\n\r\nMost functional requirements may eventually emerge because of clearer customer understanding.  Unfortunately, most quality goals will not and those that do are unlikely to emerge early.\r\n\r\nInternal quality goals such as code understandability and testability, will never emerge from domain understanding.  Some high-profile external goals such as safety, security, and privacy may emerge, but at unpredictable times.  Others, such as ease of use, reliability, and responsiveness, will emerge if there are gross quality failures.  A focus on functionality will delay emergence of most quality goals.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, waiting for quality goal emergence is a poor idea and unnecessary.  Waiting results in the accumulation of sizable technical debt during early iterations.  Debt piles up because quality support functions, such as exception handlers, are missing everywhere.\r\n\r\nUse of a comprehensive quality model enables quality goals to be identified early.  It also enables the early specification of both quality achievement and quality verification strategies.  Such a quality model is freely available at www.quality-aware.com/q-a-daves-stuff.php.  The steps to fix Agile and any other incremental development process can be found at www.quality-aware.com.\r\n\r\nSEI publications state that understanding quality goals is an important prerequisite to good architectural decisions.

Performance also impacts the usability and user adoption rate after the system goes live. However, performance issues usually show up during the later phases of the project or during system implementation such as Load / Stress Test and / or User Acceptance Test (UAT) when data volume scales up. The probable cause is a lack of non-functional requirements on performance at an early stage of the architectural design. This presentation is to conceive and show how to salvage a troubled project with performance issues that focuses on performance and storage trade-offs, and how Architecture Analysis Tradeoff Method (ATAM) is used to leverage the performance and storage trade-offs.

This presentation is based on my real-world experiences in salvaging two multiple-million dollar projects in a very short period. Neither project conducted architecture quality attributes workshop (QAW). The performance issues were so severe that the projects were subject to be cancelled. The root of causes were extensive data aggregation with heavy computation and sorting on a low-end databases. One of the two projects simply tried to reuse a simple mobile application architecture with 2 search criteria and less than 100 thousand records on a PostgreSQL to a full blown application with 100 million records with over 20 search criteria. When performance issues appeared at UAT, $2 million dollars were already invested in the project. I will present a quick turnaround options including tailored solutions ranging from increasing hardware / network capacity, database tuning / query optimization, API optimization, to the implementation of Solr or Elasticsearch to address the performance issue. The examples I will use in the presentation will be performance and storage trade-offs that leverage the Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time. The architectural dynamics, challenges, and impacts such as Solr indexing time impact to the existing ETL process and PaaS issues will also be presented. The practical knowledge of this presentation will benefit architects and business decision makers to understand the important of Architecture Quality Attributes and how to address performance issues with tailored solutions.\r\n\r\nI think the presentation belongs to Track 3: Other topics interest - Addressing quality attribute concerns, such as performance, availability, usability, security, and interoperability\r\n","abstract":"Why do so many projects have system performance issues at a later stage of implementation?

I think the talk description uses the term SLA inaccurately. SLA is a document that may specify perfomance requirements, among other things. I'd argue that the majority of software systems out there do not have such a document in effect. So, saying \"The performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a non-functional requirement that is used as an acceptance criteria for almost every project / system\" is an overstatement to me. But if you drop the term \"Service Level Agreement (SLA)\", the sentence sounds quite valid. \r\n\r\n2. Likewise, the SLA document doesn't impact usability. It's performance that affects usability. \r\n\r\n3. The talk description uses quite some space to discuss the general importance of performance as a quality attribute requirement. I believe that's not the focus of the talk, but as is the description becomes less interesting, because many SATURN attendees are well aware that performance requirements are important. The title and description could be more specific and clearly indicate what kind of performance optimization is discussed. In other words, I suggest you say in the title and abstract what specific kind of performance solution you'll present. \r\n\r\n4. You say \"The probable cause is a lack of defined architecture quality attributes and vague non-functional requirements on performance at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\" It's not clear to me what is \"defined architecture quality attributes\" versus \" non-functional requirements on performance.\"  Also, I think it would make more sense to say \"at an early stage of the architectural design\" instead of \"at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\"\r\n\r\n5. The phrase \"I will also discuss detailed issue resolution approaches to address performance concerns from end-to-end\"  sounds very general and hence too ambitious. Maybe you should be more specific, such as \"... performance concerns from end-to-end in systems that deal with text search on indexed data sets. \r\n\r\n6. The term \"storage trade-offs\" is not clear. Is is about tradeoffs regarding the choice of infrastructure used for persisting data? Maybe RDBMS vs NoSQL databases? Maybe tradeoffs related to Lucene indexing options? \r\n\r\n7. SATURN attendees are interested in technologies, tools, frameworks that have been used successfully. So, in an unbiased fashion, you could try to mention tools such as profilers and performance monitors that you have used. Learning about the experience of others with such tools may raise the interest in your talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"sorting from back**end database to Solr \"\r\n\r\n- \"and be access*ed* over http\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z"},{"id":3747,"submission_id":8268,"talk_id":15740,"user":{"name":"George Fairbanks","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7617/George-Fairbanks.png","email":"gf@georgefairbanks.com"},"body":"I'm drawn to this talk because of the specifics of the case studies as described in the Notes section.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. Today Software Architecture is taught at many undergrad and graduate academic programs in the US and abroad. Also, there are many professional training classes available. Some are vendor agnostic (such as the SEI courses), others are offered by vendors, such as Microsoft and Oracle. In your presentation, do you consider taking classes on software architecture an effective possible step in the roadmap? \r\n\r\n2. The software architect should also have a clear understanding of quality attributes, such as modifiability, availability, performance, and security. He/she should know how to elicit and document quality attribute requirements, because these requirements are the most important architecture drivers. \r\n\r\n3. The architect should also understand that architecture consists of multiple structures, which are documented in multiple views. He/she should know how to communicate the multi-view architecture effectively. Many times this communication involves diagrams, so the architect should know UML or know how to create and use an informal diagram notation consistently. \r\n\r\n4. A question that could be discussed in your presentation: is there value in pursuing one of the different available software architecture certifications? \r\n\r\n5. The architect should also know how to create, document, and evaluate an architecture. \r\n\r\n6. Years ago people at the SEI software architecture group engaged in a discussion about the duties, skills and knowledge of an architect. One of the results of that discussion is on [this web page](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/research/previousresearch/duties.cfm). It might have useful information for your presentation. \r\n\r\n7. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n8. It would be interesting to see a discussion of what has changed in recent years in the role of architect in the \"digital era\", the era of microservices, containers, and agile development. \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T20:02:45.410Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T20:02:45.410Z"},{"id":3947,"submission_id":7996,"talk_id":15195,"user":{"name":"Pradyumn Sharma","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c5b87d50700eeed460070d11880dc17?s=500","email":"pradyumn.sharma@gmail.com"},"body":"Hello Paulo,\r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestions and inputs. \r\n\r\n1.

Different nodes on different machines try to communicate with each other as well different devices and controllers do. \r\nThese IoT devices can certainly connect through a lot of different ways, but in this talk I focus on cellular connectivity. Obviously, other receptions are always limited to the access point, and also dependent on network and device configurations. Cellular has reception everywhere without any maintenance effort from the customer side, so with telecom access a large-scale investigation is possible. Given the ubiquity of sim based IoT devices, cellular solutions can achieve an unbelievable level of coverage in both space and time for observing any events.\r\nIf we take IoT and wanna use it in a large scale for example in agriculture industry in Africa, we have to built a suitable large architecture. As low-energy network does not exist there and can provide connectivity only on one site, so the communication with the combine on the field will be always insecure. Even SMS can play a role as an intermediate solution and help with device distribution or middleware. GSM network always can be used, even if internet is not available, which makes it reliable and persistent channel for IoT connectivity.\r\nIn my talk I include not only an agriculture, but also e-health, logistic and alarm system cases, with journey map and code demonstration.\r\n\r\nCheers, Karina","created_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z"}]}},{"id":6786,"submission":{"id":6786,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2016-11-30T04:43:58.355Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T21:17:09.133Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVTF4vXmw-c","rating":25.75,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["quality attribute models","essentially complex models","quality goals"],"profile":{"name":"David Gelperin","bio":"David Gelperin is CTO of ClearSpecs Enterprises.

I'm very interested in the topic of software quality, but I'm sorry to say that I'm finding your description a little perplexing.\r\n\r\nThe title is confusing me.  My initial thought was that you were saying \"Software Quality Attributes Considered Harmful.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, reading the introduction paragraph makes me think you are actually saying is \"Poor Quality is Risky\", or perhaps \"A Little Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing\" because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly.\r\n\r\nBy \"essentially complex\" do you mean \"necessarily complex\"?  i.e.  This is the level of complexity that is needed as a minimum, you cannot go any simpler than this?\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"essentially complex\" do you actually mean that the model is complex by nature.  Complexity is often seen as a undesirable, , so complex nature could be a bad thing.\r\n\r\nReading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base.  Am I right in thinking that this is the \"Essentially complex quality model.\"  Since you are presenting it, then I assume it must be a good thing.  The title and introduction don't make this clear.\r\n\r\nAlso, you begin the second paragraph referring to \"some at the SEI.\"  You then refer to \"We\".  Is the \"We\" the people at the SEI, or are you referring to the people ClearSpecs Enterprises? \r\n\r\nI hope you can understand my confusion and can help me clarify my understanding.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\n\r\nGed","created_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z"},{"id":3023,"submission_id":6786,"talk_id":12965,"user":{"name":"David Gelperin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/58dc7fd3fec8a0f1410e81c70809f012?s=500","email":"david@clearspecs.com"},"body":"Sorry for the confusion. \r\n\r\nI changed the title to \"Qualities are Very Complex\" because that is my message.  I am using \"essential complexity\" as Fred Brooks does.  DNA, the London subway, and Einstein's theory of relativity are each more complex than a triangle or benzene molecule.  \r\n\r\n\"Essential complexity\" is neither bad nor good.  It is a scalar characteristic, like weight.  By definition, if I build a model or solve a problem, the essential complexity of the thing being modeled or the problem being solved determines the essential complexity of an accurate model or an effective solution.\r\n\r\nWhile understanding higher levels of essential complexity is very difficult, simplistic understanding can be dangerous.  If the software in a self-driving car is simplistic, people will die needlessly.  \r\n\r\n“A Simplistic Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing” because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly. – Yes   Complexity is often seen as undesirable, [just like too much weight], so complex nature could be a bad thing – No [Human intelligence is not a bad thing, but unnecessary complexity is a bad thing.]  Reading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base. Am I right in thinking that this is the “Essentially complex quality model.” – Yes\r\n\r\nHere is the rewrite:  Qualities are Very Complex\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of a project, you should identify likely project risks.  Quality goals may be among them.  These goals must be defined, achieved, and verified.  We show that current quality models are simplistic and then describe a quality model of sufficient complexity.\r\n\r\nWe highlight the features of a quality knowledge base that outlines over 60 quality attributes, their support and conflict relationships, and their tactics for goal definition, achievement, and verification.  This knowledge base is freely available and enables you to identify your quality goals and strategies at the beginning of a project.  If you don’t use it, you may waste time and increase project risk.\r\n\r\nImprovement suggestions much appreciated.

IMO, a “quality model of sufficient complexity” doesn’t sound very enticing to the agile, framework-oriented developer of today.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with all but the word \"simple\".  The set of quality attributes and some individual attributes like safety and security are NOT simple (just like DNA).  Some attributes have entire books written about them. Their specification, design, and verification is NOT simple.\r\n\r\nI understand that I am \"selling\" complexity (reality?), but the earth is not flat and orbits are not circular.  Simplistic models of quality attributes will never produce predictable quality.\r\n\r\nAs to enticing the Agile crowd, there are many problems.  I have written that \"Agile is a Quality Antipattern\" and \"Fixing Agile\".  \"Pure\" agile is simplistic.  It can work great as long as you ignore quality goals.  These goals don't fit the Agile paradigm because they should be identified and specified early and achieved and verified in every iteration.  In surveys of current Agile practice, over 50% of the responders don't following any coding standards.  These Agile projects build huge quality debt starting from the first increment.

A lot of focus is put on the *initial development* aspect, before the first delivery, and little attention is given to the *maintenance phase* of the software system. With more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models, creating long-lived Internet systems that aren’t forgiving to downtimes or cumbersome data migrations, maintenance becomes much more important and critical to the overall design of the system than the initial development.\r\n\r\nAgile offers a different, *Emergent* method to design software, with small iterations that, when combined with continuous delivery and learning, results in a design that’s much more adaptive to changing requirements. Taken to the extreme, we shorten the initial development phase to a minimum and focus mostly on iterative maintenance steps. \r\n\r\nHowever, the conditions required to facilitate Emergent Design require that the development team refrain from over-engineering and YAGNI violations - two problems that are prevalent in the software industry, especially with less-experienced engineers. Outside-In Development is a methodology that helps us focus on the Semantics rather the Mechanics of our software, protect us from YAGNI violations, and thus facilitate Emergent Design. Practicing TDD helps us implement this methodology in the scope of a commercial software project, by helping us cultivate a Beginner’s Mind towards software design.","notes":"I will start by describing the gap between how engineers usually view software design and how Internet-scale systems actually evolves. I will then make the point that software isn’t like bridges, cars or other “classical” engineering projects. I will use the biological analogy, talking about software as a garden and how we always build on existing system state, and how software engineering is an ongoing, evolving effort. I will claim that a paradigm shift is needed towards wide adoption of Emergent Design.\r\n\r\nNext, I will explain why traditional software engineering training is deleterious to this paradigm shift, with people learning to think about static, rather than evolving, software design, and are taught more about the mechanics of software (design patterns, technology) and less about the semantics (creating the right abstractions). I will discuss Outside-In Development and explain how it helps stick to the YAGNI principle, and how this facilitates Emergent Design. I will explain that it’s hard to adopt outside-in due to the way engineers are trained and how cultivating a Beginner’s Mind helps us put aside these problems and achieve outside-in.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will explain how practicing TDD helps us cultivate the Beginner’s Mind and facilitate outside-in, with test-first serving as the outside user of a system or subsystem, and how the Refactoring phase of TDD helps design emerge.\r\n\r\n### Presentation History:\r\nInitially developed in 2014 as an internal Wix.com tech talk.

First and foremost, I can't actually promise that anything I say is new to the audience of SATURN, although I have delivered this talk in earlier formats at various European conferences, including XP2016 in Edinburgh earlier this year, and got positive feedback.\r\n\r\nOne major difference is that I'm talking about Test-Driven *Design* rather than Test-Driven Development. Many talks and books deal with Test-Driven Development, focusing on the \"how\"s rather than the \"why\"s - how to write unit tests, for instance, rather than \"what's in it for me\". My talk, and to a greater extent my epiphany, has to do with our fallacies as software engineers, their origins, and how TDD, by helping us cultivate a beginner's mind, can aid in getting rid or taming these fallacies, which include YAGNI violation, over-engineering, pattern obsession and so on. \r\n\r\nWhile this talk doesn't relate to software architecture in the common sense (topology, microservices, databasesm etc), it does deal with how adhering to TDD as a methodology is beneficial for software organizations that develop web-scale, long-lived Internet systems, as was our experience at Wix.com.","created_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z"},{"id":2651,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Shai, Thanks for the update!

I don't understand what you mean by \"more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models\" in practice. Do you mean more development organizations are creating their software solutions as SaaS? Is it true for the enterprise? Or do you mean more organizations are using various SaaS solutions, such as dockerhub and github? \r\n\r\n2. I think maintainability is an important quality attribute requirement for software systems in general. If you use patterns and tactics that promote maintainability, I think you are giving attention to the maintenance phase. In the first paragraph, it seems you are saying that BDUF does not focus on maintainability. I don't think that's the problem with BDUF. The problem is that you design beyond what's known at the beginning. If you start coding earlier, initial releases will give you incredible understanding of runtime/maintainability issues that help to drive downstream design in the right direction. \r\n\r\n3. Here's what wikipedia says about Emergent Design: \"With emergent design, a development organization starts delivering functionality and lets the design emerge. Development will take a piece of functionality A and implement it using best practices and proper test coverage and then move on to delivering functionality B. Once B is built, or while it is being built, the organization will look at what A and B have in common and refactor out the commonality, allowing the design to emerge. This process continues as the organization continually delivers functionality.\"\r\nI'm not sure this is your interpretation of emergent design. In any case, it is important to reflect about some points. Is this approach good in all cases? If not, what's the criteria to decide when to use it? Aren't there tradeoffs related to following emergent design? What kinds of design decisions are in the scope of this approach? Does emergent design prevent the use of techniques (such as DDD) that ask you to design beyond the scope of a scrum sprint functionality? \r\n\r\n4. From the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program, I think the title+description don't make it clear what the talk is about. The title makes you think it's about TDD. The description may make you think the talk is about Emergent Design and/or the outside-in development approach. \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6. In the description, consider adding what participants will learn, that is, how do they benefit from this talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"Semantics rather *than* the Mechanics\"\r\n\r\n- \"protect*s* us from YAGNI\"\r\n\r\n- \"and thus facilitate*s* Emergent Design\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z"},{"id":3972,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Shai Yallin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e68285df5c6b2561d0453845b7b2b5ac?s=500","email":"shai.yallin@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Paulo,\r\nRe: 1 - I mean that companies start offering their products as SaaS rather than on-premise. I think this also applies to enterprise, yes - if you look at major software companies, such as HPE - who have traditionally been offering on-prem solutions only.\r\n\r\nRe: 2 - yes, I agree with what you say. But I think that the mere act of *performing* a BDUF will create a mindset that thinks in terms of a deliverable (\"car\") rather than an evolvable (\"garden\").\r\n\r\nRe: 3 - note that I'm not referring to scope, or to sprints. I'm referring to letting design emerge rather than forcing a design that stems from the mind of an architect (and not from evidence). What recently became clearer to me is that most of what I say is applicable mainly to Applications, as defined by Lehman (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman's_laws_of_software_evolution).\r\n\r\nRe: 4 - what I'm trying to say is that TDD is a great way to promote emergent design, by helping the engineer cultivate a beginner's mind.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. I fully agree with Yogeshwar. You should also discuss the challenges and drawbacks of serverless architecture. Software architects need to understand the tradeoffs that come with any design decision. A lot of material we see out there about the newest and brightest idea often only emphasize the benefits. Surely serverless is not the best solution for all cases.\r\n\r\n2. The term serverless is actually quite broad and poorly defined. For example, [Mike Roberts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) associates serverless to the use of MBaaS (more common), or alternatively richer clients (SPA?) talking to services behind an API gateway. Thus, I hope your talk has a clear description of what a serverless architecture is.

Sketching helps with brainstorming ideas, iterating through concepts, and communicating your ideas to others. Whether working individually or in a group, your ability to sketch helps take the abstract ideas out of heads and into the real world. If you’re not comfortable sketching then there is little chance that your ideas will stick with you, your team members, and even your clients. Don’t worry—the confidence you need to put your pen to paper and start to sketch is close at hand! With the addition of a few simple approaches to your daily routine, you too can harness the power of sketching. \r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n- Developers can sketch.\r\n- Understand the benefits of sketching and why it is important for developers\r\n- Learn specific techniques to power up your sketching skills\r\n- See the power of sketching firsthand by taking part in sketching activities\r\n\r\nCome prepared to do fun sketching activities in this hands-on talk so you can experience the power of sketching firsthand. \r\n","notes":"The goal of my talk is to help both designers and non-designers understand the power of sketching. Everyone has great ideas to share and the faster we get them out of our heads and into the physical world the quicker we can move forward. \r\n\r\nAgenda of my talk:\r\n\r\n- Talk about the power of sketching. \r\n- Comparison of two designers and how they approach sketching and what effects that has on their careers. \r\n- Tools needed to sketch. \r\n- Sketching Activities - I have the attendees do a few sketching activities to help them understand the power of sketching firsthand. (This has been a wild success at previous talks.)\r\nAfter each activity, I have the attendees discuss the sketches with each other to help them practice talking about their sketches.\r\n- Close out the talk by showing sketches from my 30-day sketching challenge and how it transformed my sketching skills.\r\n\r\nI want the attendees to understand that the transformation from a little bit or not at all sketching to harnessing the power of sketching is not a long time. All it takes is some consistency and effort. I want to leave them inspired and pumped up to start sketching.\r\n","abstract":"The power of sketching lies in using sketching to ideate, iterate, and communicate our ideas.

I'm a bit torn regarding your proposal.  On the one hand I agree that sketching is a useful and powerful tool.  I also enjoy sketching exercises and have seen the many positive benefits of becoming a confident sketcher - including my own 30 day sketch challenge.  On the other hand, at least with software architecture design, we are often concerned with models and reasoning.  I worry that your proposal overemphasizes sketching without a clear connection to modelling and using the sketches to reason about important system properties.\r\n\r\nPros I see in this talk\r\n\r\n* Looks like a really interactive hands on session\r\n* Presenter is passionate about the topic\r\n* Sketching is a useful skill and something many developers could use more practice with.\r\n\r\nCons I see in this talk\r\n\r\n* No clear connection to software architecture\r\n* Risks further perpetuating boxology and \"architecture is just boxes and lines\" mentality with no connection to modelling or otherwise using diagrams to reason about system properties\r\n\r\nRizwan, What is your vision for where the sketching techniques you'll practice during the session will fit in a developer's tool box?

Since I don't have a full grasp of the software architecture domain I would start off by getting architects to understand the power of sketching, which is using sketching for ideation, iteration, and communication of ideas. The sketching activities are designed to show them how little time it takes to sketch and that anyone can sketch. After each activity, I ask the attendees to show their sketches to a person next to them to practice using sketching to communicate.\r\n\r\nDevelopers can then take this knowledge and firsthand experience and apply it to their workflow/processes the very next day. \r\n\r\nTo make a stronger connection with the conference topic I can add a specific software architecture sketching activity.
