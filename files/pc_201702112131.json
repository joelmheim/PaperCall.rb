In agile projects, this means being part of every sprint that needs architecturally significant decisions. In order to do this successful, a good collaboration between the technical lead and the architect is necessary. What I've regularly seem in practice, is that both roles are not always present in the same team: some projects might be to small (budget, man days, scope, ...) while many others are organised sub-optimal. One of your review-colleagues also pointed this out.\r\n\r\nBoth roles have some things in common (eg. leadership) and some of the tips I want to provide, should assist in creating this synergy: as a technical lead pay attention to architectural decisions, collaborate on the decision-making process. Get involved. You can see that this requires a different approach with or without a formal architectural role. I too often saw technical leads putting all their focus on \"tools\" and \"frameworks\" and I believe this alone is not enough to deliver successful systems (and sometimes it can be enough). Leadership is about being able to delegate, collaborate (with architects, developers, business people, ... stakeholders). An architect should embrace working with a technical lead, guide him, elevate him. And a technical lead should also embrace working with an architect: support him with technical options, ...\r\n\r\nI strongly believe collaboration will aid both roles to perform better and become better. The roles have both similarities and differences. And that's a really good thing.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nBart Blommaerts","created_at":"2017-01-24T08:25:28.238Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T08:25:28.238Z"},{"id":3601,"submission_id":7199,"talk_id":13762,"user":{"name":"Ged Byrne","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef4de37718ebb5c4fc1c2236331ee9d9?s=500","email":"ged.byrne@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Bart,\r\n\r\nThanks for replying.

However, I'm not so interested in the implementation details.\r\n\r\nI would love to see a talk provide an good, practical overview of the topic for the architect.  This is an area of debate for architects, so I think it is a very relevant field for discussion.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the first addition of \"Software Architecture in Practice\" the statement was made: \"Making a system's user interface clear and easy to use is primarily a matter of getting the details of a user's interaction correct … but these details are not architectural.\"\r\n\r\nIn later editions this position was retracted with a section called \"Usability Mea Culpa (or that’s not Architecture)\" but other architects still disagree.  Consider this blog post that insists that usability is important, but still not architecture: http://enterprise-it-architecture.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/usability-is-not-architecture-quality.html\r\n\r\nAs somebody with a passion for and experience of achieving accessibility, could you explain to architects why this is an important quality attribute and the role that architects play in improving it?\r\n\r\nIf you could include some well defined quality scenarios [1] and relevant architectural tactics [2] that would be very desirable.  The testing approach would be covered by the tactics and you might want to focus on this in particular.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this would be quite a deviation from your current proposal.  You may think of something closer to what you already have that will help to convince architects that this is something they need to be interested in.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=4\r\n[2] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=5\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z"},{"id":3640,"submission_id":7723,"talk_id":14675,"user":{"name":"Gerard Cohen","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/3931/GerardKCohen400x400.jpeg","email":"gerardkcohen@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Ged,\r\n\r\nI can understand why architects do not feel that usability, or UI, belongs in the realm of architecture. I can tell you from my own personal experiences that bad/ lazy service architecture can definitely impact and lead to bad UI. A lot of times, these things are in the name of security or performance and sometimes they can be smoothed over on the front end, but most times they can't. Speaking as a Front-End architect, performance is just as much a part of usability as accessibility is. \r\n\r\nI would agree that implementation of accessibility will not be of any interest to most architects, unless they are front-end like myself. But if you are interested in having the discussion of how bad architecture could lead to bad usability, I certainly have a few anecdotes that I could share.","created_at":"2017-01-25T03:33:17.197Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T03:33:17.197Z"},{"id":3644,"submission_id":7723,"talk_id":14675,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"There was a great [talk on globalization last year at SATURN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPabgSykvD8&list=PLSNlEg26NNpy1RjhlISNMRNO1gypYaXHo).

At the same time, it seems that most of web accessibility is related to implementation details - color choice, proper tagging, good naming, navigation orders for JAWS, etc.\r\n\r\nI think the goal for most SATURN attendees would not be to become an accessibility expert, but to learn enough to not make bad trade-offs as Gerard mentioned (e.g. security over accessibility) or at least be aware that trade-offs are happening.  The proposed talk will go into significant detail that I don't think will be of general interest.  I realize that's a little sad since this is an important topic.  I think a shorter talk that gives a good overview and emphasizes the top things an architect should know might be a better fit for the audience.\r\n\r\nGerard -- What are your thoughts for your proposal based on the feedback?

An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices","description":"An invisible app? An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices\r\nI know what you're thinking. You want to know what the triple-A app titles already know. It's Inclusive Design, a process to deliver intuitive usability; it is the heart-and-soul of great User Experience and innovative interactions. Your app is in a cosmic battle with the Uninstall button; inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor. Appeal to your largest audience, provide cohesive experiences, and reduce development costs. It is an investment with one of the best returns in all of software. It's simple, cheap and awesome.\r\n\r\nApplication security is fundamental to software from initial design to every line developed. Security should not be an afterthought. Similarly, usability has this same ubiquity throughout the life-cycle of software. The fastest, most secure, most scalable software can end up in the trash because it misses the most important success criteria for any program in the universe - user acceptance. Software architecture profoundly impacts usability. Usability profoundly impacts acceptance. Architects may not choose app colors, error messages, and device layout, but they certainly make choices that enable and constrain designers options that make our software better. Like security is everyone’s responsibility at some level, so is usability at some level.\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees learn? Inclusive design isn’t only usability; it’s recognizing that your user base changes as their social and environmental contexts change. If your user is standing in the sun, waiting for a train in the snow, holding a baby, riding a bus, visiting a library or watching the big game in a sports bar, applications can account for the one type of user that, given a certain context, looks and acts like another type of user. Inclusive design helps developers understand these contexts. It applies these to our implementations to add modalities, flexibility in workflows, and intentional tolerance for user mistakes. Developers will learn to recognize contextual assumptions and apply new, potential contexts to their existing user base so they can serve them best while consequently serving a new, larger user base.

Not a problem, but it would avoid someone the confusion if you explicitly said UI desing somewhere (example: \"Inclusive UI Design\"). \r\n\r\n2) In the Description, it would be useful to qualify app as \"mobile app\" in at least one place. \r\n\r\n3) This sentence is not clear to me: \"inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor.\"  I'm not sure changing the nature of my app is a goal to pursue.

Reading Harvard Business Review, competitive companies seek advice from totally unrelated fields to solve their most difficult problems. So why should it be any different for software architect?  The software architect’s role in leading teams and influencing business decisions cannot be overlooked. \r\n\r\nJohn Ryskowski would love to reveal the big band drummer’s strategy for success and its attendant parallels to the software architect’s “situation.”  Of course, band stories and drumming demonstrations will be included.\r\n","notes":"Session Requirements:\r\n1) To start a conversation that will last throughout the rest of the conference. \r\n2) To obtain a “fresh perspective” by taking folks down the path of a totally unrelated field and drawing pertinent parallels for and with them. \r\n3) As an architect one must create and nurture the vision for the DNA of the product, in spite of the project situation. The big band drummer must nurture a good sound from the big band, in spite of the gig situation. The parallels between the two should be realized, discussed, and brought to grounded historical experiences for each attendee. \r\n4) To introduce some new language that may help put project situations into perspective allowing one to return to clarity of thought. Psychologically speaking we get some relief from having name for some events or techniques. For example, I need to vary my intensity to get the group affect that I desire.\r\n\r\nThe session breakdown:\r\nHandouts: The actual drum chart for the subject of the talk- Kubis’ arrangement of “A Train,” and the “Clapping at Camp” chart written for audience participation. Big sticky papers will be on the walls of the room. \r\n\r\n1) Explain how one path to a fresh perspective is to experience something that is totally unrelated, but at the same time reveals grounded parallels to your situation. Executing a big band chart requires a strategy with known techniques but the flexibility to grab opportunities to inspire and transcend the moment. Through subtle and timely queues, the drummer can instill a sense of confidence and inspire the band to play better than they imagined. The techniques we discuss could have the same effect for the people on the architect’s project.\r\n2) Through demonstration, we discuss some of the possible variations the drum set can offer. This would include the elements of the drum set with each of their different sounds, the 4 limbs of the body, and just some of the combinations thereof. We will stick with the combinations that are most pertinent for this talk, and don’t forget the eyes and brain play a role as well. \r\n3) We get into a discussion about some of the situations the big band drummer must deal with. Does the band leader know little about music (or does the manager of the program or product owner know little about the technology)?  Does the lead trumpet think he is with the Count Bassie band (or is your development principle unaccustomed to this environment)? Can the bass player not play in time (or does your development principle have no sense of time)? Is the drum set in the absolute worst location to work with the rest of the band (or are you stuck without a reasonable means of communication with the rest of the team)? I will demonstrate how the big band drummer overcomes each of these situations. \r\nI then ask each member of the audience to choose which situation they resonate with most. Audience members will then join 1 of 4 groups to discuss their personal situations, their solutions or possible solutions then elect the top 3 solutions to brief the rest of the other groups. \r\n4) Two vital techniques in big band drumming are then discussed: “Distinguishing signal from noise” knowing the current location of the chart without listening to anyone’s sense of time, and “Some of your great ideas may not be so great.” The audience will then be asked to verbalize their own parallels, and If the interest and energy are present, we can briefly split into two groups, discuss and brief.\r\n5) The “Kubis” chart is then projected on the screen and actually played on the drum set asking the audience to try and observe, as best they can, all that is going on with the drum set performance. We then deconstruct each element of successful drum chart execution. Each element and a lesson to take away:\r\na) Element- Initiating and maintaining a tempo for the band. Lesson- What is least exciting for you may be most important to them.  You set the tone for what is to come and instill a sense of calm. Sometimes you’re just a piece of leverage. Wow that last one hurt.\r\nb) Element- Identify milestones. Lesson- Marking points in time to celebrate progress, ensure social/technical alignment, and instill confidence.\r\nc) Element- Vary intensity as needed. Lesson- Selectively applying energy at the right times and in the right places, balancing support, teaching, and inspiration.\r\nd) Element- Special care. Lesson- Sometimes hand-holding is necessary.\r\ne) Element- Set them up for success. Lesson- Anytime you set someone up for success, they feel good and want to work with you. \r\nThe audience is once again, asked to choose which of these they resonate with most. Audience members will then join 1 of 5 groups and discuss their personal situations (or parallels) amongst their group. Each group will then brief the other groups. \r\n6) The “Clapping at Camp” chart is introduced. I show how without even being able to read music (or a rhythm chart) I can still set them up for success. We rehearse the sections of the chart. Then we perform the chart together and they clap in time like they were born to do it. It’s really fun.\r\n\r\nPresentation History\r\nThis topic has been presented at Agile West, Las Vegas, 2016. \r\nSummary score of 8.69. Total attendees 45. Total of 4 written comments here verbatim:\r\n1- Fun! Fun! Fun! Perspective and musical metaphor\r\n2- Novel application and most engaging session by far! \r\n3- Very unique, engaging, and appropriate. One of my favorite presentations and many parallels were illustrated.\r\n4- Content was delivered in a muddled way. Good points were buried in musician stories and metaphors.\r\n\r\nReferences to Speaking Ability\r\nI like to pull people out of their everyday situations, immerse them into something completely different that is fun and interesting, then help them to draw parallels back to their everyday situations. This is an efficient path to a fresh perspective, which is the most valuable take-away from any conference.  \r\nThe ideal reaction cycle I strive for is: a) I wonder what that would be like, b) cool I didn’t know that, c) whoa I need to try this out. \r\nI have spoken at Agile West, CMMI Institute Conferences, Pacific Norhwest Software Quality Conference, National Defense Industrial Association. I have also delivered good and bad news to leaders of many corporations. \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\nKerry Trujillo,  Kerry_Trujillo@raytheon.com, see linkedIn recommendation\r\nMichael West, michael@naturalspi.com\r\n","abstract":"How does the architect ensure a great product, in spite of, well, the situation at hand?

I’m curious if any parallels to architect or architecture surfaced during your presentation at that venue. This proposal fits Topic 3, “The software architect’s role in leading teams and influencing business decisions” in the call for presentations. There are different ways to approach this, with perspectives on people, process, or product. It is not necessary to cover all perspectives though I’d like to better understand where you will probe for parallels. Do you think the product (software architecture) will be a point of discussion or will it be more about stories of people and process?\r\n\r\nYour notes provide a good sense of the topics covered and the flow through the session. A little more information about timing within the 90 minutes would be helpful. The breakdown into element and lesson gives a sense of the parallels between drummer and leadership (in general). Would you say more about the points you will make about how these relate more specifically to the architect’s “situation”.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-22T21:41:20.835Z","updated_at":"2017-01-22T21:41:20.835Z"},{"id":3545,"submission_id":8273,"talk_id":15752,"user":{"name":"John Ryskowski","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e795a4d0ff0b82e8a8d24a73044fa41f?s=500","email":"jfryskowski@yahoo.com"},"body":"Hi Robert- I appreciate the interest.\r\n\r\nTiming and did any parallels to architect surface at Agile West- The Agile West presentation was limited to 45 minutes and so had a lot less group participation than what I am proposing for SATURN.  The group participation discussed in steps 3, 5, and possibly step 4, in the SATURN proposal are an addition to this version of the talk. These group exercises will allow for a richer processing experience for the folks than what happened at AW. All this added up gives me about 35 minutes for 2 or 3 group participation exercises which should be no problem. This is general time estimate, if specific time allocations are required I would be happy to add them.  Additionally, in this limited time, at AW no parallels to architect came up at AW.\r\n\r\nAs for being under topic 3, I am happy to go with that. People, process, or product- the parallels will focus mostly on people. People are the common point between BB drumming and architects. But to be honest with you, I am not sure where these group exercises will go. One of the verbal comments after my talk at AW was that I did not presuppose to know the parallels exactly, and left space for attendees to formulate their own. It is the opening of this space that is my objective, less so giving a direct answer.   \r\n\r\nFrom you- The breakdown into element and lesson gives a sense of the parallels between drummer and leadership (in general). Would you say more about the points you will make about how these relate more specifically to the architect’s “situation”. \r\n\r\nResponse- From the 5000 foot perspective, the BB Drummer and architect have the same challenge. Take responsibility for the vision and integrity of the product without being given any authority or owning any of the resources. From lower altitude I am happy to make some adjustments though I do worry about anchoring, or disrupting where participants can go with their parallels. How do you feel about the “additions” below?\r\n\r\n5a) Element- Initiating and maintaining a tempo for the band. Lesson- What is least exciting for you may be most important to them.  You set the tone for what is to come and instill a sense of calm. Sometimes you’re just a piece of leverage. Wow that last one hurt. Addition- While trying to balance creativity, risk, stakeholders and the responsibility to change the world, it is good to have a basic rhythm that all can operate to. \r\n\r\n5b) Element- Identify milestones. Lesson- Marking points in time to celebrate progress, ensure social/technical alignment, and instill confidence. Addition-  Is there a build and release rhythm you can work to?\r\n\r\n5c) Element- Vary intensity as needed. Lesson- Selectively applying energy at the right times and in the right places, balancing support, teaching, and inspiration. Addition- The creative process comes down to a give and take in real time. You must dabble in interactions with people in the “known” before you can step over to the “unknown.”\r\n\r\n5d) Element- Special care. Lesson- Sometimes hand-holding is necessary. Addition- Sometimes you don’t have to blow up the village in order to save it. Education and patience can pay off. \r\n\r\n5e) Element- Set them up for success. Lesson- Anytime you set someone up for success, they feel good and want to work with you. Addition- Introduce people to the patterns that you see with grace and composure to assure overall success. \r\n\r\nBest- John \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T01:50:50.787Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T01:50:50.787Z"}]},{"id":7988,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-13T07:16:01.261Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T20:03:44.013Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":36.2857142857143,"trust":70.0,"tag_list":["community building","architects","education","career path"],"profile":{"name":"Dmitriy Gurskiy","bio":"Senior Solution Architect, Deputy CTO at EPAM Systems\r\n\r\nTechnology stacks: .NET, JavaScript\r\n\r\nBusiness domains: Science, Finances, Insurance, Media and Advertizing","twitter":"","company":"EPAM Systems","url":"","shirt_size":"Men's M","email":"dmitriy_gurskiy@epam.com","location":"Unknown"},"talk":{"title":"Building architectural community of seven hundreds engineers in global ISV company","description":"Being a Deputy CTO in global ISV company, I 'm responsible for Solution Architecture discipline growing.

Your talk seems very interesting and will probably attract a lot of people, because SPA and frameworks like Angular and React are very popular these days. However, SATURN is a conference where the primary focus is software design. Although attendees are interested in talks focused on implementation, many also expect to see a design discussion. \r\n\r\nHere are some suggestions that could make a talk on Angular 2 more suitable for the SATURN conference: \r\n\r\n1. What are the tradeoffs of creating single page applications (versus traditional Web app frameworks like JSF)? What are pros and cons wrt usability, performance, maintainability, portability, testability, etc.?  \r\n\r\n2. How should you design server-side components for interaction with SPA apps? Serverless? Microservice? Nodejs? \r\n\r\n3. What evaluation criteria should be used to pick a JavaScript framework? Technology choice is an important design decision and many organizations today are choosing among options such as AngularJS 1, AngularJS 2, ReactJS, EmberJS. \r\n\r\n4. How would you organize the implementation artifacts of a software project that contains AngularJS for the presentation layer, and, for example, Java-based microservices?  This organization is directly related to the deployment view of the architecture, and affects the way you structure the artifacts on a git repository, as well as the way you create your CI jobs. \r\n\r\n5. What are lessons learned and good practices beyond the basics of AngularJS and Typescript programming? What tools or browsers work better for debugging? Any way to analyze code quality (ESLint, TSLint)?  What criteria to choose between bootstrap, material UI, angularUI, etc.? What's the best way to deal with CORS? And so on.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-10T10:52:04.716Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T10:52:04.716Z"}]},{"id":7895,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-11T14:59:39.001Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T20:03:43.639Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36g1aoVvyrY\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISKA10JQOuo\r\nhttps://www.infoq.com/presentations/server-nashorn-spring","rating":37.75,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["testing","agile","cloud","cd","ci"],"profile":{"name":"Topher Bullock","bio":"Topher is a senior software engineer at Pivotal and is based out of the Toronto, Canada office.

CI and build pipeline design is certainly an important issue, especially with more and more teams moving to distributed systems such as microservices.

Generally I cover the internals to illustrate why Concourse is a good solution for a specific case within CI/CD, but I can also move more towards a generalist CI/CD strategy talk where Concourse is simple an illustration of a solution to a specific problem.\r\n\r\nA specific example I cover is how testing commits to various microservice repos can be integrated together into a pipeline that eventually deploys software externally, and I show an example Concourse pipeline that illustrates this. I can definitely expand more on the former, and provide a good CI/CD strategy overview in the context of distributed systems, microservices, and container orchestration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback!

The double proposals leave it up to us to judge what is the best way to get your message across, which may or may not work in your benefit.\r\n\r\nI like the building a team aspect of your talk, architects often double as leads in one way or another, with or without reporting line responsibility. It seems that you have delivered or intend to deliver this material at developer oriented conferences. We usually see some (lead) developers at SATURN, but please clarify whom your presentation will work for or how it will work for different groups.\r\n\r\nYour outline confuses as it is up-high (team-building) and down in the details (hands-on penetration testing). Now having read both proposals, I'd recommend you to update the 30 min session to a focussed talk with a clear value proposition for architects and lead-developers. Dropping more technical material.

The presentation is not hands on, where as the workshop is. Many people find that they learn better if they actually play with the tools. Playing with the tools is what happens in This workshop. The workshop will work well if we can get the VM I have to attendees before the workshop. Attendees need to have this setup and runable before the workshop, otherwise it usually takes up to much time during the workshop. If we can get a network share setup that attendees can download the VM, and follow the directions I provide before the workshop then it usually works well. Also having a box of NTFS formatted 16GB USB sticks loaded with my VM, that can be handed out on and/or during the conference or even in the workshop, has worked well as a backup plan.\r\n\r\nThis submission can also be run as a tutorial, which takes less time, due to the non hands on nature, no one has to set anything up other than myself. If run as a tutorial, I just run through the tooling parts as a workshop myself. This way attendees get more of an idea how things fit together than they would if it was just the short presentation.\r\n\r\nNumbers also play a part in what works best. If a large number of people wish to attend, then the presentation works best. If over 20 - 30 developers attend, then usually the workshop turns into more of a tutorial, unless, we are really organised and attendees are fully setup before the tutorial/workshop. I have 4 USB  sticks that I can pass around during the workshop, but this only works if there are 20 or less developers in the class.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, the workshop offers the most, but only if you can support the facilities required and both of us provide excellent comms to people wishing to attend the workshop in the weeks and days leading up to it. My preference is the presentation, as it is less work, but it's your call, I'm happy to run either.\r\n\r\nI have run quite a few training's similar to this before:\r\n\r\nNodeConfEU (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#security-regression-testing-with-zapapi-and-nodegoat-nodeconf-eu) was a similar workshop (45 people in the class), that may have ended up more of a tutorial, but didn't as we had a box of USB sticks loaded and a network share and had good comms with the attendees before the session.\r\n\r\nDevSecCon (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#devseccon-asia-2017-developing-a-high-performance-security-focussed-agile-team-2-hour-workshop) is aiming to host a similar workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, developers/engineers generally get a lot out of this. For me, I generally try not to differentiate to much between devs and architects. An excellent architect should still have their hands on the tools, it's just that they are also expected to be in a lot of other places at the same time. For the architects with less hands on involvement, the tutorial or even presentation style may be best suited to them. In saying that though, if everyone is setup before the workshop, then I can usually hold hands fairly firmly through the hands on content.\r\n\r\nThe content, whether hands on or not, in many cases is quite eye opening, so there are good take aways for all. My last presentation at AgileNZ (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#agilenz2016-agile-security-for-web-developers-50-minute-presentation) which was mostly targeted toward developers, was still well received by the audience which were mostly Product Owners, Managers and Architects. The AgileNZ presentation had quite a bit of the same content as what I've submitted here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high and low level together is what my book series addresses and encourages development teams (PO's, Managers, Architects, Engineers) to grasp and understand. First chapter being 30'000 foot view, which leads into 10,000 foot view, then into some fairly detailed asset identification, risk identification, countermeasure identification, etc... based on Bruce Schneier's Sensible Securitty Model (SSM). The content teaches all people involved in the process of building technical solutions to think outside of their tunnel vision. Architects to think about low level details and Engineers to think holistically, hence the title: \"Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developer\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by clear value proposition? Does the following not provide this:\r\n\"have proven their value in:\r\n(1) Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market)\r\n(2) Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs)\r\n(3) Without descoping\r\nand all while reducing total project cost (fact)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be happy for some assistance to formulate this better for SATURN if you would be keen to help?\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that has clarified most of it?\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z"},{"id":3622,"submission_id":8056,"talk_id":15299,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Kim, thank you for the clarification!

In the dojos I have setup / ran, teams are building their products while learning new skills and directly applying them to what they are building.  To give you an example, the last team I was with was building an OAuth service to be used by multiple front-ends.  So they were learning OAuth, along with microservices (Spring Boot in this case), while building with drone / gradle, deploying via kubernetes...all done test driven.  We were doing this in the frame of building their product.  For the majority of the people - it was two teams, about a total of 10 developers - these were new skills. So instead of reading a site and trying to apply something or take a course in one topic, we sat and worked directly with teams on how to build 'the right product, the right way.'  Other teams have learned Java (coming from mainframe), mobile development, etc.  I have even ran these with non-technical teams like L&D or marketing.\r\n\r\nSo what goes on?  Learning in the context of building your stuff.\r\n\r\nI am of course biased to a dojo approach - I like the idea of whole teams learning together in their context.  I would offer up that if you just have a single skill that needs to be amplified, a dojo wouldn't be right.  For example, if you just need to understand kafka - then yeah, a dojo might be overkill.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJoel","created_at":"2017-01-27T13:13:25.618Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T13:13:25.618Z"},{"id":3746,"submission_id":8167,"talk_id":15519,"user":{"name":"George Fairbanks","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7617/George-Fairbanks.png","email":"gf@georgefairbanks.com"},"body":"I'm open to the idea that dojo style could be used in software design / architecture, but the abstract doesn't help me understand how that connection.

The SEI should know this and lead a campaign to fix it.\r\n\r\nAgilists believe that requirements “emerge” during iterative development.  They also believe that Big Requirements Up Front (BRUF) is an Agile anti-pattern.  While BRUF may be a poor strategy for gathering functional requirements, it is the best strategy for identifying quality goals.\r\n\r\nMost functional requirements may eventually emerge because of clearer customer understanding.  Unfortunately, most quality goals will not and those that do are unlikely to emerge early.\r\n\r\nInternal quality goals such as code understandability and testability, will never emerge from domain understanding.  Some high-profile external goals such as safety, security, and privacy may emerge, but at unpredictable times.  Others, such as ease of use, reliability, and responsiveness, will emerge if there are gross quality failures.  A focus on functionality will delay emergence of most quality goals.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, waiting for quality goal emergence is a poor idea and unnecessary.  Waiting results in the accumulation of sizable technical debt during early iterations.  Debt piles up because quality support functions, such as exception handlers, are missing everywhere.\r\n\r\nUse of a comprehensive quality model enables quality goals to be identified early.  It also enables the early specification of both quality achievement and quality verification strategies.  Such a quality model is freely available at www.quality-aware.com/q-a-daves-stuff.php.  The steps to fix Agile and any other incremental development process can be found at www.quality-aware.com.\r\n\r\nSEI publications state that understanding quality goals is an important prerequisite to good architectural decisions.  This suggests that most quality goals should be identified early.  This conflicts with stated Agile beliefs and current Agile practice.  The SEI has been silent on this conflict.  It is time to speak up and campaign for Quality-Aware Agile.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will\r\n•\tExplore current quality practices with attendees\r\n•\tDescribe why Agile and every incremental development process is broken\r\n•\tDescribe the added tasks of Quality-Aware development\r\n•\tSimulate a review and tailoring of the LiteRM quality model in an inspection overview format\r\n•\tExplore objections to using these proposals with attendees","notes":"None","abstract":"Agilists believe that Big Requirements Up Front is an Agile anti-pattern.

Pitfalls and dangers exist at every turn in the Global Jungle (data sovereignty, currency, scale, right to left languages, legal risk, regulations, hackers, latency, global benchmarking/analytics… even natural disasters to name a few).  Most applications either barely limp through or don’t survive this unforgiving jungle.  Where do you start if you are building something from scratch?  What about if someone else built it but only built it thinking about their country (or for their limited users)?  In this session I will share my experience and equip you with the gear you need to survive the next time you enter the Global Jungle.

This is not altogether different for how small startups often stumble or fail when they try to transition to the big leagues.  As far as context goes, I think this applies to any web, desktop or mobile system (internal to an organization or used by the public) that is intended to be used by individuals in multiple countries across the globe.  In particular if you are dealing with private or sensitive data.  When I refer to the “global jungle” I am talking about the multitude of things that you often don’t think or worry about when you \"first build\" your solution for your \"first user base\", but can be a catastrophic problem when you try to transition to a new region or the globe (and forces you back to the drawing board or worse yet becomes a fatal flaw and threatens your overall business model).  What do you feel is the best way to clarify the context due to its broad nature? <br><br>\r\nHow Deep? <br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nMy goal in this session is not to attempt to make anyone an expert in any given area.  Instead I want to give them an awakening so that they walk away with a new found appreciation that there are a bunch of other things they should spend some critical time on; since by spending it now it may very well either save their project from an unanticipated problem or differentiate them since their competitors failed to consider them.  Think back to when you first heard the horror stories around security and that had a lasting impact on your belief that it is something that shouldn’t be ignored.  I want to try to do the same for many other aspects that few people take seriously until it’s too late. <br><br>\r\nADVICE/TAILORING? <br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThis listing is what I have cultivated over the years and have used successfully to make both large and small systems “globally ready” and successful for the largest business unit of a 36.8 billion dollar company (for both internet and internal facing solutions).  The last few parts 7, 8, 9 are where I would try to give them some structured advice on how to balance all of these considerations so that they can prioritize and mitigate the risks while still having rapid agility in \"their jungle\". <br>\r\nThoughts?

Modules are design-time units with fixed domains and hidden design decisions. Modules particularly promote systematic correctness analyses. However, these beneficial properties disappear once the modules have been integrated into and deployed on target machines. For embedded systems that run within tight real-time constraints, modules may even hamper integration tests and fault analyses, due to the inaccessibility of modules' internals. Hence, for an HW/SW-integration platform of an X-by-wire eCar, we developed HDCs in order to non-intrusively trace and test the behavior of single and multiple modules (HDCs) integrated into one or more platform nodes.\r\n\r\nHDCs transfer modules from design-time entities to runtime entities. HDCs can be tested in integrated systems during field operation, without code instrumentation and probing effects. For this purpose, the HDC runtime environment captures data structures that flow within and between HDCs for one macro cycle (e.g. lasting 10 ms) of the time-triggered system; each macro cycle anew. An HDC can access only internal and parametric data structures. The probe is the only HDC with full access to all data structures, including its own. Because they are half-open for the probe and half-closed for all other HDCs, we call these data capsules hemispheric.\r\n\r\nIn the presentation, we will first reveal requirements behind HDCs originating from an industry study on an HW/SW-integration platform providing safety services to a fail-operational eCar (www.projekt-race.de/en). We will then sketch tests that can be run for HDCs. This motivates the design of an HDC system and its effect on the application and implementation of HDCs in general and the probe in particular, which we will describe afterwards. We will critically reflect on our experiences with HDCs during development, in the lab and in the field, as well as on the applicability of HDCs to event-triggered, object-oriented systems as basis for discussion.","notes":"","abstract":"A Hemispheric Data Capsule (HDC) is a runtime entity of a module with externalized data structures.

It is a time-triggered system that must perform critical functions within milliseconds.

Please see the agenda in last paragraph of the lecture description.\r\n\r\n(2) Ad \"implementation disadvantages and costs\", \"guide developers to HDCs\" and \"what worked or didn't work\".\r\n\r\nConsiderations of issues and drawbacks are necessary for a balanced picture on HDC. Following your comments we will explicitly address chronometric hits because timing considerations are important for a real-time system that works with tight operation schedules.\r\n\r\nA proper place for talking about challenges in general with HDC could be the section \"critical reflection on HDC\" which is already on the agenda.

The insights to be gained from data are endless. In light of this a new paradigm of the real-time communication between things has emerged, in which the quality of life of citizens in dense urban environments is increased through the security of using big data and cloud technology. Future cities are likely to feature thousands of strategically placed sensors that would record everything from air pressure and temperature to microbial content, and the data would be relayed instantly to the smart devices of actively participating citizens, who will make critical contributions to urban planning, reducing pollution, and making the best use of finite resources.\r\nThe proposed solution is the mobile connectivity that provides the network coverage wherever devices may roam. Secure cellular connection together with SIM cards and endpoints can be easily managed in real-time via the intuitive user-interface or directly from the customer’s software application via an easy-to-integrate API.

These IoT devices can certainly connect through a lot of different ways, but in this talk we will focus on cellular connectivity.  \r\nObviously, other receptions are always limited to the access point, and also dependent on network and device configurations. Cellular has reception everywhere without any maintenance effort from the customer side, so with telecom access a large-scale investigation is possible. Given the ubiquity of sim based devices, cellular solutions can achieve an unbelievable level of coverage in both space and time for observing any events.\r\nIf we take IoT and wanna use it in a large scale for example in agriculture industry in Africa, we have to built a large suitable, secure and cost-efficient architecture/system. As low-energy network does not exist there and can provide connectivity only on one site, so the communication with the combine on the field will be always insecure.\r\nEven SMS can play a role as an intermediate solution and help with device distribution or middleware as GSM network always can be used, even if internet is not available, which makes it reliable and persistent channel for IoT connectivity.\r\nThis talk is more focused on use cases with real-time or time-critical services, of course it can impact economic and security.\r\n\r\nSnowy regards from Germany, \r\nKarina","created_at":"2017-01-31T14:44:57.109Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T14:44:57.109Z"}]},{"id":8010,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-13T18:34:46.858Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T18:27:20.251Z","additional_info":"N/A, I was speaking at the last Saturn conference in San Diego","rating":10.8,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":[],"profile":{"name":"Alexander von Zitzewitz","bio":"Alexander von Zitzewitz is founder, managing director of the company and CEO of the US subsidiary.

One device sends data to other device that can use this data.IoT can make the existing healthcare system more efficient in terms of Time, Energy and Cost.\r\nBy embedding IoT devices into existing medical equipment, patients can be monitored more effectively. Data obtained from these devices can be used to make proactive decisions.\r\n•\tThe Learning:\r\n•\tMassive impact on life and business.\r\n•\tHuge incoming data from connected devices and ensuring devices can hold data securely.\r\n•\tChallenges in managing enormous volume of data.\r\n•\tQuality of data and power consumptions.\r\nThe Act:\r\n•\tHigh performance data management systems.\r\n•\tInnovations in sensor technologies and setting up secure networks.\r\n\r\nMarket Trend and Prospect: \r\n•\tThe Internet of Things will be the largest device market in the world. It is estimated that by 2019 it will be more than double the size of the smartphone, PC, tablet, connected car, and the wearable market combined.\r\n•\tThe IoT will result in $1.7 trillion in value added to the global economy in 2019. This includes hardware, software, installation costs, management services, and economic value added from realized IoT efficiencies.\r\n•\tDevice shipments will reach 6.7 billion in 2019 for a five-year CAGR of 61%. Revenue from hardware sales will be only $50 billion or 8% of the total revenue from IoT-specific efforts, as software makers and infrastructure companies will earn the lion's share.\r\n•\tThe enterprise sector will lead the IoT, accounting for 46% of device shipments this year, but that share will decline as the government and home sectors gain momentum. By 2019, government will be the leading sector for IoT device shipments.\r\n•\tThe main benefit of growth in the IoT will be increased efficiency and lower costs. The IoT promises increased efficiency within the home, city, and workplace by giving control to the user. However, many are hesitant to use devices as security problems are still an issue.\r\n\r\nCase study:\r\nSmart Hospitals Using Internet of Things (IoT)\r\nMost of the time, due to negligence of hospital staff, excessive number of patients or inattentiveness of relatives it may happen that saline bottle is not monitored properly and it may lead to cause heart attack due to “AIR EMBOLISM”. In a hospital, numbers of electrical equipments (fan, lights) are more so energy is more. Thus, it is important to use electricity as per the requirement. Thus, in this paper we have proposed a system which include combination of sensor technology and Internet of Things (IoT).Using this system one can control switch of the electricity and monitor level of the saline bottle from distant position.\r\nIoT Testing\r\n\r\nAbout MQTT Protocol\r\nAccording to the specifications, MQTT is client/server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol. It is lightweight, open, simple, and designed so as to be easy to implement. These characteristics make it ideal for use in many situations, including constrained environments such as communications in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) contexts, where a small code footprint is required and network bandwidth is at a premium.\r\n\r\nClient/Server Message Pattern\r\nMQTT uses publish/subscribe model to deliver all messages to interested clients. In this model, a publishing client (publisher) does not send requests directly to each receiving client. Instead, it publishes the message to the server known as broker, which, in its turn, forwards data to the clients that need them.\r\nThis way the publisher can send only messages to the specific address. Otherwise, it would have to update the list of clients constantly and send multiple messages on every update. This may be impossible for publishers with low processing power or limited Internet connection.\r\nClients, who want to receive data, subscribe to the broker. They subscription model allows them to subscribe to specific topics and, thus, filter out the messages they do not need.\r\n Both the publishers and clients send a Connect message to work with the broker.\r\nThe described solution also allows the broker to send messages if the publisher has connection issues, or if the client is offline when a message is published. The broker stores the message and sends it to all newly connected subscribers and a Will message is sent when the publisher has connection issues.\r\n\r\nWill Message\r\nMQTT ensures the message delivery even if the network issues happen, or if the publisher suddenly goes offline. This mechanism is known as a Will message. The Will message is sent to the broker when the publisher connects, and it is published in case the publisher disconnects without sending the Disconnect message. If this happens, the Will message will be posted, and the broker will send it to all subscribed clients.\r\n\r\nMQTT Testing in Ready! API\r\nReady! API can act both as a publisher and as a client for MQTT broker. We can use it to create functional and load tests.\r\n\r\nMQTT Functional Testing\r\nTo test the broker's functionality, we need to create a SoapUI NG test that uses the MQTT-related test steps:\r\nTest Step\t                               Description\r\nPublish Using MQTT\t               Establishes MQTT connection and publishes the message specified in test step properties.\r\nReceive MQTT Message\t       Subscribes to an MQTT topic and waits for the first message posted to it.\r\nDrop MQTT Connection\t       Simulates the publisher disconnecting from the server, either in the normal way by sending a Disconnect message, or unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nMQTT Load Testing\r\nTo see how MQTT broker performs under heavy load, We need to create a load test for it in LoadUI NG. We first create an MQTT test case in SoapUI NG, and then create a load test that simulates this test case with dozens and hundreds of virtual users running on a locally or remote machines. \r\n","notes":"","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices connected to each other.IoT can make the existing healthcare system more efficient in terms of Time, Energy and Cost.By embedding IoT devices to medical equipment, patients can be monitored effectively and proactive decisions can be made.\n\n","audience_level":"All","talk_format":"DEV@SATURN Talk (15 minutes)"},"ratings":[{"id":29657,"submission_id":9260,"value":1,"comments":"","created_at":"2017-02-10T11:22:04.343Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T11:22:04.343Z","user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"}}],"feedback":[{"id":4424,"submission_id":9260,"talk_id":17577,"user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"},"body":"Hello Shravan and Muthumeena, \r\n\r\nThank you for your submission. We have received a record-high number of submissions this year. There were many excellent proposals, more than we could accept due to the limited number of spots. I hope you can join us at SATURN May 1-4 in Denver. I also hope you can submit again to SATURN 2018. With that in mind, I'd like to give you some feedback on your proposal. \r\n\r\n1. SATURN is focused on software design and attracts mostly software architects and seasoned developers from industry. You can make your talk description shorter and more objective.

I'm not sure what do you mean by \"The Act\".\r\n\r\n3. In the talk description you say \"in this paper we have proposed a system which...\"  Please keep in mind there is no paper submission for SATURN. You only need to submit a proposal for a presentation to be given to an audience that is primarily composed by practitioners in industry and government. \r\n\r\n4. It seems there's a broken sentence that starts with \"IoT Testing\".\r\n\r\n5. It's not quite clear whether the proposal is a case study (experience report) or a general tech talk about IoT or IoT testing. If it's an experience report, then the focus should be on the important design decisions and lessons learned (what worked, what you would do differently). \r\n\r\n6. Still related to the unclear nature of the talk... the description uses a lot of space describing MQTT and related development/testing frameworks.

Performance also impacts the usability and user adoption rate after the system goes live. However, performance issues usually show up during the later phases of the project or during system implementation such as Load / Stress Test and / or User Acceptance Test (UAT) when data volume scales up. The probable cause is a lack of non-functional requirements on performance at an early stage of the architectural design. This presentation is to conceive and show how to salvage a troubled project with performance issues that focuses on performance and storage trade-offs, and how Architecture Analysis Tradeoff Method (ATAM) is used to leverage the performance and storage trade-offs.

This presentation is based on my real-world experiences in salvaging two multiple-million dollar projects in a very short period. Neither project conducted architecture quality attributes workshop (QAW). The performance issues were so severe that the projects were subject to be cancelled. The root of causes were extensive data aggregation with heavy computation and sorting on a low-end databases. One of the two projects simply tried to reuse a simple mobile application architecture with 2 search criteria and less than 100 thousand records on a PostgreSQL to a full blown application with 100 million records with over 20 search criteria. When performance issues appeared at UAT, $2 million dollars were already invested in the project. I will present a quick turnaround options including tailored solutions ranging from increasing hardware / network capacity, database tuning / query optimization, API optimization, to the implementation of Solr or Elasticsearch to address the performance issue. The examples I will use in the presentation will be performance and storage trade-offs that leverage the Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time. The architectural dynamics, challenges, and impacts such as Solr indexing time impact to the existing ETL process and PaaS issues will also be presented. The practical knowledge of this presentation will benefit architects and business decision makers to understand the important of Architecture Quality Attributes and how to address performance issues with tailored solutions.\r\n\r\nI think the presentation belongs to Track 3: Other topics interest - Addressing quality attribute concerns, such as performance, availability, usability, security, and interoperability\r\n","abstract":"Why do so many projects have system performance issues at a later stage of implementation?

I think the talk description uses the term SLA inaccurately. SLA is a document that may specify perfomance requirements, among other things. I'd argue that the majority of software systems out there do not have such a document in effect. So, saying \"The performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a non-functional requirement that is used as an acceptance criteria for almost every project / system\" is an overstatement to me. But if you drop the term \"Service Level Agreement (SLA)\", the sentence sounds quite valid. \r\n\r\n2. Likewise, the SLA document doesn't impact usability. It's performance that affects usability. \r\n\r\n3. The talk description uses quite some space to discuss the general importance of performance as a quality attribute requirement. I believe that's not the focus of the talk, but as is the description becomes less interesting, because many SATURN attendees are well aware that performance requirements are important. The title and description could be more specific and clearly indicate what kind of performance optimization is discussed. In other words, I suggest you say in the title and abstract what specific kind of performance solution you'll present. \r\n\r\n4. You say \"The probable cause is a lack of defined architecture quality attributes and vague non-functional requirements on performance at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\" It's not clear to me what is \"defined architecture quality attributes\" versus \" non-functional requirements on performance.\"  Also, I think it would make more sense to say \"at an early stage of the architectural design\" instead of \"at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\"\r\n\r\n5. The phrase \"I will also discuss detailed issue resolution approaches to address performance concerns from end-to-end\"  sounds very general and hence too ambitious. Maybe you should be more specific, such as \"... performance concerns from end-to-end in systems that deal with text search on indexed data sets. \r\n\r\n6. The term \"storage trade-offs\" is not clear. Is is about tradeoffs regarding the choice of infrastructure used for persisting data? Maybe RDBMS vs NoSQL databases? Maybe tradeoffs related to Lucene indexing options? \r\n\r\n7. SATURN attendees are interested in technologies, tools, frameworks that have been used successfully. So, in an unbiased fashion, you could try to mention tools such as profilers and performance monitors that you have used. Learning about the experience of others with such tools may raise the interest in your talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"sorting from back**end database to Solr \"\r\n\r\n- \"and be access*ed* over http\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z"},{"id":3747,"submission_id":8268,"talk_id":15740,"user":{"name":"George Fairbanks","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7617/George-Fairbanks.png","email":"gf@georgefairbanks.com"},"body":"I'm drawn to this talk because of the specifics of the case studies as described in the Notes section.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. Today Software Architecture is taught at many undergrad and graduate academic programs in the US and abroad. Also, there are many professional training classes available. Some are vendor agnostic (such as the SEI courses), others are offered by vendors, such as Microsoft and Oracle. In your presentation, do you consider taking classes on software architecture an effective possible step in the roadmap? \r\n\r\n2. The software architect should also have a clear understanding of quality attributes, such as modifiability, availability, performance, and security. He/she should know how to elicit and document quality attribute requirements, because these requirements are the most important architecture drivers. \r\n\r\n3. The architect should also understand that architecture consists of multiple structures, which are documented in multiple views. He/she should know how to communicate the multi-view architecture effectively. Many times this communication involves diagrams, so the architect should know UML or know how to create and use an informal diagram notation consistently. \r\n\r\n4. A question that could be discussed in your presentation: is there value in pursuing one of the different available software architecture certifications? \r\n\r\n5. The architect should also know how to create, document, and evaluate an architecture. \r\n\r\n6. Years ago people at the SEI software architecture group engaged in a discussion about the duties, skills and knowledge of an architect. One of the results of that discussion is on [this web page](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/research/previousresearch/duties.cfm). It might have useful information for your presentation. \r\n\r\n7. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n8. It would be interesting to see a discussion of what has changed in recent years in the role of architect in the \"digital era\", the era of microservices, containers, and agile development. \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T20:02:45.410Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T20:02:45.410Z"},{"id":3947,"submission_id":7996,"talk_id":15195,"user":{"name":"Pradyumn Sharma","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c5b87d50700eeed460070d11880dc17?s=500","email":"pradyumn.sharma@gmail.com"},"body":"Hello Paulo,\r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestions and inputs. \r\n\r\n1.

I was immediately drawn by the title. \r\nAlexander talked about the importance of architecture conformance and showed a tool to help with that. \r\nWhen I was watching I thought: 'In our organization, we do the same thing in a different way, also with great results. Maybe I could give a talk with the same title.' So, this is it. \r\nOur approach to architecture conformance is fully automated, incredibly simple and yet powerful and flexible. It's based on free open-source tools, but requires some coding (the fun part). Developers can find out they're violating, for example, your layered design, when they insert an undesirable dependency in the code. They can see that on the IDE itself. If they ignore, the CI build will detect and report the issue. For more strict design rules, you also have the option to block code commit to the git or svn repository. This approach shows how much we care about the architecture--we create it carefully and make sure it is not neglected for the entire life cycle of the project.","notes":"This 15-minute talk is a teaser for the 90-minute tech tutorial that I also submitted (titled \"Ultimate Architecture Enforcement – Write Your Own Rules and Enforce Them Continuously\"). \r\n\r\nHere I will describe the basics of our approach to architecture enforcement, some results after 6 years of successfully using the approach, and lessons learned. \r\n\r\n","abstract":"The architecture you carefully created requires your attention throughout the life cycle of the project.

Different nodes on different machines try to communicate with each other as well different devices and controllers do. \r\nThese IoT devices can certainly connect through a lot of different ways, but in this talk I focus on cellular connectivity. Obviously, other receptions are always limited to the access point, and also dependent on network and device configurations. Cellular has reception everywhere without any maintenance effort from the customer side, so with telecom access a large-scale investigation is possible. Given the ubiquity of sim based IoT devices, cellular solutions can achieve an unbelievable level of coverage in both space and time for observing any events.\r\nIf we take IoT and wanna use it in a large scale for example in agriculture industry in Africa, we have to built a suitable large architecture. As low-energy network does not exist there and can provide connectivity only on one site, so the communication with the combine on the field will be always insecure. Even SMS can play a role as an intermediate solution and help with device distribution or middleware. GSM network always can be used, even if internet is not available, which makes it reliable and persistent channel for IoT connectivity.\r\nIn my talk I include not only an agriculture, but also e-health, logistic and alarm system cases, with journey map and code demonstration.\r\n\r\nCheers, Karina","created_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z"}]},{"id":7175,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2016-12-15T21:32:52.833Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T18:27:19.694Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-RBaNTGJSk&list=PLvk9Yh_MWYuwTYjxOqjzOlVmFFHvN3Yp7&index=1&t=3s","rating":62.5,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["pipelines","scale","design","devops","30-min tech talk"],"profile":{"name":"Avantika Mathur","bio":"Avan (Avantika) Mathur is the Product Manager for ElectricFlow.

Business leaders who rely on information to make complex decisions in real time could not succeed as desired because technology could not cope up with their needs till today. This decades’ long wait has finally come to an end thanks to Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Analytics. Especially Real Time Analytics powered by In-Memory Computing (IMC) offers a way out from this rut. Further still, a truly disruptive hybrid model that shrewdly mixes both, “Relying on the past to predict the future” and “Real Time Analytics” is a fool proof approach for digital era analytics solutions. \r\n \r\nBy embedding a select array of Artificial Intelligence techniques from cognitive research arena right into the core algorithms and using state of the art research projects such as SRI, CNTK and Google Tensor Flow, how we can leverage In Memory Computing to address predictive business analytics issues will be addressed in this session.\r\n\r\nHow to address complex and strategic decision needs in real time?\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nBy flexing and blending a variety of technologies within the realm of In Memory Computing, we can address all the three types of decisions, including Operational, Tactical and Strategic. While operational and tactical decisions tap into existing datamarts and datastores which house transactional, structured data, strategic decision making goes beyond the traditional stores and rely heavily on real time, unstructured data influx. \r\n\r\nReal time strategic decision making in digital era is impossible unless we shatter today’s speed and scale barriers. For speed, we can leverage In Memory Computing that tackles both latent and live streams of data. For planet scale, as the volume is huge and expected to grow exponentially, an on-demand, scalable infrastructure should be erected to contain the catastrophes. As strategic decisions need to factor in various parameters, an ensemble of machine-learning algorithms are employed to crunch data, to classify the outliers and recommend meaningful actions to deal with a specific problem at hand. An enormous number of simulations, trained models and tests are applied to the data which has been acquired and prepared before passed on to the intelligent analytics engine to arrive at precise real-time business decisions.\r\n\r\nApplied IMC Use case - Customer Intimacy \r\n==================================\r\n\r\nAs the world is becoming more complex by the moment, strategic decision making in real time is also becoming extremely difficult and is compounded by the speed and scale with which information is generated and consumed. IMC furthers the decision-making process by employing cutting-edge tools, and conceiving and deploying disruptive models to address customer concerns. When it comes to meaningful engagement with customers, relying on heuristics and instinctive impulses for strategic making is no longer reliable, in today’s rapidly changing digital landscape.\r\n\r\nThis session is designed to shed some light on a practical use case on how to enhance customer intimacy using In-Memory Computing for business analytics.\r\n\r\n\r\n","notes":"Functions and Algorithms\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThe driving force behind the use case is ‘enhancing customer experience’. With this is in mind, every customer interaction is funneled for use in a sentiment analysis. By examining every chat, email, tweet, voice transcript and logs, the attitudes, emotions, likes, preferences, habits behind the interactions are analysed using the following (indicative) machine and deep learning algorithms:\r\n\t\r\nNaïve Bayes\r\nMax ENT\r\nSVM\r\nCNN, HMM, GMM, \r\nDNN, RNN, LSTM\r\n\r\nArchitecture behind Real-Time In- Memory Analytics \r\n==========================================\t\r\nThe following  architecture principles are applied in Predictive Real-Time Business Analytics :\r\n\r\n* Real Time, In Memory Process.\r\n* Loose coupling.\r\n* Interoperability.\r\n* Modularity.\r\n* Scalability with built in CAPS.\r\n* Cloud Centric.\r\n* Mobile Centric.\r\n\r\nBy design Highly stable, open source products are plugged into the solution.\r\n","abstract":"Till today technology has failed business leaders miserably who wanted information to make complex decisions in real time.

There are a few things about the submitted abstract that I think can be improved.\r\n\r\n* The overall tone seems overly enthusiastic for the solution you're proposing, almost to the point that it reads like a sales pitch.  Surely there are some negatives to what you're proposing?\r\n* The topic is unclear and seems to touch on numerous areas.  Is this talk about AI? In memory data structures?  Streaming analytics?  Cloud? Mobile? Modular design?  I'm not seeing the theme or core lesson.  What will someone who attends your talk be able to do that they couldn't do before?\r\n* This is a lot of material to cover in 15 minutes.  Perhaps you meant to assign this to a different time slot?

I'm very interested in the topic of software quality, but I'm sorry to say that I'm finding your description a little perplexing.\r\n\r\nThe title is confusing me.  My initial thought was that you were saying \"Software Quality Attributes Considered Harmful.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, reading the introduction paragraph makes me think you are actually saying is \"Poor Quality is Risky\", or perhaps \"A Little Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing\" because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly.\r\n\r\nBy \"essentially complex\" do you mean \"necessarily complex\"?  i.e.  This is the level of complexity that is needed as a minimum, you cannot go any simpler than this?\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"essentially complex\" do you actually mean that the model is complex by nature.  Complexity is often seen as a undesirable, , so complex nature could be a bad thing.\r\n\r\nReading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base.  Am I right in thinking that this is the \"Essentially complex quality model.\"  Since you are presenting it, then I assume it must be a good thing.  The title and introduction don't make this clear.\r\n\r\nAlso, you begin the second paragraph referring to \"some at the SEI.\"  You then refer to \"We\".  Is the \"We\" the people at the SEI, or are you referring to the people ClearSpecs Enterprises? \r\n\r\nI hope you can understand my confusion and can help me clarify my understanding.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\n\r\nGed","created_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z"},{"id":3023,"submission_id":6786,"talk_id":12965,"user":{"name":"David Gelperin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/58dc7fd3fec8a0f1410e81c70809f012?s=500","email":"david@clearspecs.com"},"body":"Sorry for the confusion. \r\n\r\nI changed the title to \"Qualities are Very Complex\" because that is my message.  I am using \"essential complexity\" as Fred Brooks does.  DNA, the London subway, and Einstein's theory of relativity are each more complex than a triangle or benzene molecule.  \r\n\r\n\"Essential complexity\" is neither bad nor good.  It is a scalar characteristic, like weight.  By definition, if I build a model or solve a problem, the essential complexity of the thing being modeled or the problem being solved determines the essential complexity of an accurate model or an effective solution.\r\n\r\nWhile understanding higher levels of essential complexity is very difficult, simplistic understanding can be dangerous.  If the software in a self-driving car is simplistic, people will die needlessly.  \r\n\r\n“A Simplistic Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing” because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly. – Yes   Complexity is often seen as undesirable, [just like too much weight], so complex nature could be a bad thing – No [Human intelligence is not a bad thing, but unnecessary complexity is a bad thing.]  Reading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base.

IMO, a “quality model of sufficient complexity” doesn’t sound very enticing to the agile, framework-oriented developer of today.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with all but the word \"simple\".  The set of quality attributes and some individual attributes like safety and security are NOT simple (just like DNA).  Some attributes have entire books written about them. Their specification, design, and verification is NOT simple.\r\n\r\nI understand that I am \"selling\" complexity (reality?), but the earth is not flat and orbits are not circular.  Simplistic models of quality attributes will never produce predictable quality.\r\n\r\nAs to enticing the Agile crowd, there are many problems.  I have written that \"Agile is a Quality Antipattern\" and \"Fixing Agile\".  \"Pure\" agile is simplistic.  It can work great as long as you ignore quality goals.  These goals don't fit the Agile paradigm because they should be identified and specified early and achieved and verified in every iteration.  In surveys of current Agile practice, over 50% of the responders don't following any coding standards.  These Agile projects build huge quality debt starting from the first increment.

Okay, not really, but you are providing the equivalent as your user experience. This hurts your <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/responsive-design-ranking-factor-228464\">SEO potential</a>, and drives traffic away from your site.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s get a quick rundown on what responsive web design actually means within the context of an ordinary website. This definition from <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2013/05/what-is-responsive-web-design.html\">Small Business Trends</a> sums it up nicely:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Responsive Web design is an approach whereby a designer creates a Web page that “responds to” or resizes itself depending on the type of device it is being seen through. That could be an oversized desktop computer monitor, a laptop, a 10-inch tablet, a 7-inch tablet, or a 4-inch smartphone screen.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>So with this in mind, let’s take a look at hypothetical look at a website on a few different devices.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=690%2C224&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"multiple-devices\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=600%2C195&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=720%2C234&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\r\n<p>Guys…. Stop thinking about coffee and let’s focus!</p>\r\n<p>Maybe the importance of this isn’t really seeping in and maybe you’re more of a numbers person… Let’s try another route.</p>\r\n<p>80% of internet users own a smartphone per <a href=\"http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/\">Smart Insights</a>. According to <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/why_marketers_should_keep_sending_you_emails\">MicKinsey &amp; Company</a>, Google says 61% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site they had trouble accessing and 40% visit a competitor’s site instead. A report by <a href=\"http://visual.ly/mobile-web-usage-2015-and-onwards\">Wolfgang Jaegel</a> found that 91% of mobile users say that access to content is very important.</p>\r\n<p>In all seriousness, it is a big deal if your site does not work on mobile devices. Think about the kittens!!  And if you’re thinking, “there aren’t THAT many devices out there,” and “it can’t be THAT hard to be responsive,” think about those kittens one final time.</p>\r\n<p>I am sure there is a number out there on the internet waiting to be found telling us how many devices are web capable, and <a href=\"https://www.perfectomobile.com/list-of-supported-devices\">I am also sure it’s large</a>. Keep in mind each device is designed differently, with different software requirements, default browsers, and different hardware specs. That means, as a developer, no matter what you’re building, you will likely find yourself daydreaming of how many kittens you’d prefer were being hit in the face, while you debug the fifth CSS error you encounter in Safari, that never existed in Chrome&#8230;Sorry, that got a bit personal.</p>\r\n<p>As much as I would like to believe my iPhone is having an identity crisis, that’s not the actual case. There are standards out there for web design (sometimes sketchy ones), that are intended to help developers and browsers work within boundaries that help to simplify things. And I know what you’re thinking.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you, mobile gods. We’re saved!</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"design-gods\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\r\n<p>But we haven’t quite saved those kitties just yet.</p>\r\n<p>You may still be thinking, “Why do you need to know all this?”</p>\r\n<p>If you’re a business owner looking to increase your audience and you haven’t taken the responsive route, that should be the first thing on your to-do list. Online shopping is already a huge trend and still growing at this rate. If you’re trying to get your blog out there over a product, what better place for someone to read that than on their device while in the restroom? I mean really… we’ve all done it…</p>\r\n<p>If you’re looking to get a better <a href=\"http://www.marketpath.com/digital-marketing-insights/8-reasons-to-have-a-responsive-web-design-infographic\">return on your investment (ROI)</a>, responsiveness is another way to do that. If you do not have a fully responsive design, you are throwing away potential page views and potential dollars pulled in from your mobile shoppers.</p>\r\n<p>Now onto saving all those kittens!</p>\r\n<p>If you’re not familiar with WordPress or its standards, there are these things called themes. I mean, to take it directly from the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes\">WordPress Codex</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. These files are called template files. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>To put it simply, a theme is the look and feel of your site via functionality and design. It’s the idea that you can do anything with your content within the provided templates and have a consistent and clean flow.</p>\r\n<div><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=690%2C376&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"elegant-themes\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?w=970&amp;ssl=1 970w, https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=600%2C327&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=720%2C392&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p>Popular WordPress themes from Elegant Themes</p></div>\r\n<p>There are thousands of themes out there to pick from. Whether you’re building a store front, a restaurant front and menu, a non-profit donation location, a blog, or an educational site, there is something out there for you. There are many free options, usually offered through the CMS that’s been installed, and paid options that tend to be found via outside sources.</p>\r\n<p>So get to searching for the responsive theme that fits your needs, either through <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a> or through a seller like <a href=\"https://themeforest.net\">ThemeForest</a>. The kittens will thank you.</p>\r\n<p>If you go searching and nothing seems to catch your eye (insert joke about cats chasing the red dot of doom), there are always custom themes. This is the option for businesses that are looking for a specific look or functionality that they can’t find anywhere else. Being unique can be a huge benefit to a business with the right design and implementation. This is a costlier option but usually has a higher turn around on traffic and offers more options for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and design tactics. Marketing teams usually love this option!</p>\r\n<p>That’s it, that’s all you have to do.</p>\r\n<p>As developers, we have to do much much MUCH more to make something like a custom theme or purchased theme modifications (maybe I’ll write about that in the future for all the dev-heads out there wanting to help the kitties), but as a website owner using WordPress, that’s all you have to do; find a theme that is responsive. You can look more into the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack plugin</a> to help with SEO as well (yet, again, maybe another post for the future).</p>\r\n<p>So get out there and start saving those kittens! I believe you will make the right decision!</p>\r\n<p>Also, if you need some emergency kittens, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmrgencyKittens\">go here.</a> You’re welcome.</p>\r\n","notes":"This talk is great for those who are just starting to learn CSS or web design, but still helpful to those who have been creating sites for a few years.

A lot of focus is put on the *initial development* aspect, before the first delivery, and little attention is given to the *maintenance phase* of the software system. With more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models, creating long-lived Internet systems that aren’t forgiving to downtimes or cumbersome data migrations, maintenance becomes much more important and critical to the overall design of the system than the initial development.\r\n\r\nAgile offers a different, *Emergent* method to design software, with small iterations that, when combined with continuous delivery and learning, results in a design that’s much more adaptive to changing requirements. Taken to the extreme, we shorten the initial development phase to a minimum and focus mostly on iterative maintenance steps. \r\n\r\nHowever, the conditions required to facilitate Emergent Design require that the development team refrain from over-engineering and YAGNI violations - two problems that are prevalent in the software industry, especially with less-experienced engineers. Outside-In Development is a methodology that helps us focus on the Semantics rather the Mechanics of our software, protect us from YAGNI violations, and thus facilitate Emergent Design. Practicing TDD helps us implement this methodology in the scope of a commercial software project, by helping us cultivate a Beginner’s Mind towards software design.","notes":"I will start by describing the gap between how engineers usually view software design and how Internet-scale systems actually evolves. I will then make the point that software isn’t like bridges, cars or other “classical” engineering projects. I will use the biological analogy, talking about software as a garden and how we always build on existing system state, and how software engineering is an ongoing, evolving effort. I will claim that a paradigm shift is needed towards wide adoption of Emergent Design.\r\n\r\nNext, I will explain why traditional software engineering training is deleterious to this paradigm shift, with people learning to think about static, rather than evolving, software design, and are taught more about the mechanics of software (design patterns, technology) and less about the semantics (creating the right abstractions). I will discuss Outside-In Development and explain how it helps stick to the YAGNI principle, and how this facilitates Emergent Design. I will explain that it’s hard to adopt outside-in due to the way engineers are trained and how cultivating a Beginner’s Mind helps us put aside these problems and achieve outside-in.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will explain how practicing TDD helps us cultivate the Beginner’s Mind and facilitate outside-in, with test-first serving as the outside user of a system or subsystem, and how the Refactoring phase of TDD helps design emerge.\r\n\r\n### Presentation History:\r\nInitially developed in 2014 as an internal Wix.com tech talk.

First and foremost, I can't actually promise that anything I say is new to the audience of SATURN, although I have delivered this talk in earlier formats at various European conferences, including XP2016 in Edinburgh earlier this year, and got positive feedback.\r\n\r\nOne major difference is that I'm talking about Test-Driven *Design* rather than Test-Driven Development. Many talks and books deal with Test-Driven Development, focusing on the \"how\"s rather than the \"why\"s - how to write unit tests, for instance, rather than \"what's in it for me\". My talk, and to a greater extent my epiphany, has to do with our fallacies as software engineers, their origins, and how TDD, by helping us cultivate a beginner's mind, can aid in getting rid or taming these fallacies, which include YAGNI violation, over-engineering, pattern obsession and so on. \r\n\r\nWhile this talk doesn't relate to software architecture in the common sense (topology, microservices, databasesm etc), it does deal with how adhering to TDD as a methodology is beneficial for software organizations that develop web-scale, long-lived Internet systems, as was our experience at Wix.com.","created_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z"},{"id":2651,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Shai, Thanks for the update!

I don't understand what you mean by \"more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models\" in practice. Do you mean more development organizations are creating their software solutions as SaaS? Is it true for the enterprise? Or do you mean more organizations are using various SaaS solutions, such as dockerhub and github? \r\n\r\n2. I think maintainability is an important quality attribute requirement for software systems in general. If you use patterns and tactics that promote maintainability, I think you are giving attention to the maintenance phase. In the first paragraph, it seems you are saying that BDUF does not focus on maintainability. I don't think that's the problem with BDUF. The problem is that you design beyond what's known at the beginning. If you start coding earlier, initial releases will give you incredible understanding of runtime/maintainability issues that help to drive downstream design in the right direction. \r\n\r\n3. Here's what wikipedia says about Emergent Design: \"With emergent design, a development organization starts delivering functionality and lets the design emerge. Development will take a piece of functionality A and implement it using best practices and proper test coverage and then move on to delivering functionality B. Once B is built, or while it is being built, the organization will look at what A and B have in common and refactor out the commonality, allowing the design to emerge. This process continues as the organization continually delivers functionality.\"\r\nI'm not sure this is your interpretation of emergent design. In any case, it is important to reflect about some points. Is this approach good in all cases? If not, what's the criteria to decide when to use it? Aren't there tradeoffs related to following emergent design? What kinds of design decisions are in the scope of this approach? Does emergent design prevent the use of techniques (such as DDD) that ask you to design beyond the scope of a scrum sprint functionality? \r\n\r\n4. From the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program, I think the title+description don't make it clear what the talk is about. The title makes you think it's about TDD. The description may make you think the talk is about Emergent Design and/or the outside-in development approach. \r\n\r\n5.

Masinter, Intel Corporation \r\nNathan R. Peterson, Intel Corporation\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe Advanced Deterministic Random Number Generator (ADRNG) was developed at Intel Security for use with the many security products based upon the McAfee Linux OS platform. The ADRNG provides the NIST approved SP800-90A PRNG from the native Linux kernel API. It is continuously reseeded using high quality entropy bit data form the native Linux kernel Jitter entropy driver. This ADRNG is added to the Linux 4.4 kernel, and replaces the standard drivers for both /dev/random and /dev/urandom. The result is high quality random data delivered in high volume without call blocking.\r\n\r\nProblem/Opportunity\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe ability to provide a high volume of quality random data is of interest to modern Linux server systems where a great deal of encryption requires a great deal of random data. A lack of large quantities of random data may cause encryption to run slowly. A lack of quality in the random data may cause encryption to be weak. \r\n\r\nThe particular path that led us to develop this solution was increasing scrutiny of the NIST FIPS validation standards which are diving deeper into entropy quality. The ADRNG is based upon all the learning from a year long series of FIPS lab testing while validating McAfee Linux OS. \r\nQuality random data is in demande by all modern Linux servers, with or without FIPS requirements. By developing a standards based solution that plugs into the Linux kernel, we can easily share this solution with all groups at Intel, as well as making a significant contribution to the Linux kernel upstream.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe initial implementation of this idea was for the Linux 3.18 kernel. That kernel did not contain the native API for the SP800-90A PRNG nor the Jitter entropy driver. We back ported the Jitter enropy code from a later kernel, and adapted the SP800-90A routines from the Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) open source crypto library. This worked very well, but we were concerned about the large delta of kernel code required for this method.\r\n\r\nHowever since that time, we have moved to the Linux 4.4 kernel, which does contains both the SP800-90A PRNG and the Jitter entropy driver within the kernel native API. So we have updated our solution to use only the native kernel resources. This vastly reduces the size of code required, and also provides greater confidence for those that consume the solution.\r\nScope\r\n\r\nThe initial motivation to develop the ADRNG was to meet increasingly strict NIST FIPS standards. However we have enable this solution for all modes of the kernel. Thus all products based on McAfee Linux OS will benefit from the faster and higher quality random data. This results in faster and more secure encryption.\r\n\r\nMcAfee Linux OS is used by many products at Intel Security, and all of these products will implicitly inherit the advantages of the ADRNG as they each update to the lastest MLOS kernel. Increased security will benefit the reputation and sales of Intel Security products.\r\nEngineering teams working with cryptography on Linux systems, as well as Product Managers attempting to satisfy NIST FIPS standards, would all benefit from learning more about the ADRNG.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nFor measuring the results we quantify two values: Speed and Quality. \r\n\r\n### Speed Test\r\n+ Dell PE-R610 / Xeon E5540 / 2.53GHz\r\n\r\n.            64-Bytes  1K-Bytes  64K-Bytes  64Kx64-Bytes\r\n/dev/random  0m0.002s  0m0.002s  1h,36m,13s 103h,19m,46s\r\n/dev/urandom 0m0.002s  0m0.002s  0m0.008s   2m10.672s\r\nADRNG        0m0.002s  0m0.003s  0m0.036s   2m25.836s\r\n\r\nThe speed test was performed using this simple command for each algo and block size:\r\n$ time dd if=/dev/random of=/tmp/64_random.dat bs=64 count=1\r\n\r\nWe used memory based file system (/tmp/) to reduce file i/o overhead.\r\nWe can assume file i/o overhead is consistent between all tests, since all tests have the same number and size of writes.\r\n\r\n### Quality Test\r\n•\tDell PE-R610 / Xeon E5540 / 2.53GHz\r\n\r\n.             Entropy  Arithmetic-Mean     SCC\r\n/dev/random   7.999580    127.5092         -0.001245\r\n/dev/urandom  7.999960    127.4892         -0.000524\r\nADRNG         7.999962    127.5570         -0.001057\r\n\r\nEntropy bits per byte of perfect randomness = 8.000000\r\nArithmetic mean of perfect randomness = 127.5\r\nSerial Correlation Coefficient of totally uncorrelated data = 0.0\r\n\r\nThe quality test was performed using the “ent” program which applies various entropy quality tests to byte sequences. This test was run against the sum of all data produced by the speed test above, 4,260,928 bytes.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe ADRNG provides random data at the speed of /dev/urandom and with the quality of /dev/random. Thus crypto applications no longer need to choose between speed and quality, because the ADRNG provides both.\r\n\r\nLeadership\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe ADRNG will provide greater overall quality to all Intel products which incorporate it. The ISecG security products are measured in the industry by their speed and security. The ability to run encryption faster, and with higher quality, results is something that can be measured and leveredged by product marketing to maintain and extend the Intel Security market leadership.\r\n\f\r\nLessons Learned\r\nThere were so many lessons learned from the FIPS process that we could write a book on the subject. But in summary, to track and report quality, you must collect this info:\r\n\r\n+ FOR EACH: RNG, RNG-Seed, RNG-init, Entropy, Entropy-Seed, Entropy-init\r\n+ You must be able to show this info:\r\n+ Origin of algo\r\n+ Source code of algo\r\n+ Quality tests of algo\r\n+ Performance tests of algo on various hardware platforms\r\n+ Papers and Certifications of algo\r\n\r\nIt is far better to collect this info as you go through development, rather than going back at the end and attempting to compile this info.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n1.\tENT, a program which applies various entropy quality tests to byte sequences,   http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/\r\n2.\tNIST Special Publication 800-90A, Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators, Jan 2012, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf\r\n3.\tCPU Time Jitter Based Non-Physical True Random Number Generator, 2014, Stephan Müller, https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2014/ols2014-mueller.pdf\r\n","notes":"- I am the manager and co-founder of the McAfee Linux OS project at Intel Corp.

Any innovative design solutions?\r\n- challenges to create, evaluate, check conformance of the architecture.\r\n\r\nThe talk description should indicate what attendees will learn from your talk. \r\n\r\nClarification: there's no paper submission and publication for SATURN.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. I fully agree with Yogeshwar. You should also discuss the challenges and drawbacks of serverless architecture. Software architects need to understand the tradeoffs that come with any design decision. A lot of material we see out there about the newest and brightest idea often only emphasize the benefits. Surely serverless is not the best solution for all cases.\r\n\r\n2. The term serverless is actually quite broad and poorly defined. For example, [Mike Roberts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) associates serverless to the use of MBaaS (more common), or alternatively richer clients (SPA?) talking to services behind an API gateway. Thus, I hope your talk has a clear description of what a serverless architecture is. A brief definition of serverless in the talk description would also be helpful to correctly set the expectations of participants looking at the conference program.\r\n\r\n3. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n4. Like Michael, I too see significant overlap with your other submission.

You must make some intentional changes to keep your skills relevant:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\tPlatforms over Projects - The resurgence of modularity as a focus is being fueled by cloud computing paradigm.

The challenge is to avoid ivory-tower syndrome  pragmatically apply patterns that will make them most impact and reduce risk. </li>\r\n<li>Master Craftsman and Apprentice - The architect has a responsibility to mentor other techs.  With the pace of change, the architect has to be open to being the apprentice as new ideas and techniques surface through the curious developers and passionate designers.</li>\r\n<li>Master Communicator  - Whether an junior architect in training in training or a well-seasoned senior arch,  the ability to communicate crisply and succinctly is an imperative whether written or spoken.</li>\r\n\r\n","notes":"I've been an architect for over 22 years and have continually reinvented and retooled myself.

I see that I was not as clear as in intended and would love to revise if you are open to that.  Here are some of the thoughts I can elaborate on.\r\n\t\r\nI agree that some of the changes I mentioned, like master communicator, have been suggested and agreed to in the past as a quality.  Our profession, however, fell victim to over-granularity and many of these qualities were seen as \"nice to have\" and not a show stopper if they were missing.  \r\n\t\r\nThe dramatic changes in our profession make these qualities no longer are suggestions but imperatives.    The trait I mentioned are cornerstone though alone, will not be enough. \r\n\t\r\nOver the years, we've seen a proliferation of specializations for architects: middleware or integration architect, RDBMS architect, infrastructure architect, UI architect, enterprise,  and so on.  There is a gravitational pull driven by cloud and DevOps that is democratizing architectural activities and pushing the need for architects to wear many hats.  For example, the application architect understand integration and infrastructure architecture as well as operations.  An architect of any type must intentionally become more widely skilled.  We must strive to be   polymaths passionately commanding the full architectural continuum and more!   There will always be the need for a few edge architects who keep wholly focused on a single discipline though the vast majority must intentionally change their aperture. \r\n\t\r\nTo keep the example simple, consider an organization adopting DevOps principles.  For the intentional architect, this means having a full command of their ecosystem from software defined infrastructure, to pipeline engineering and deployment automation, to operational monitoring and the resulting analytics.  \r\n\t\r\nThe intentional architect needs to be a passionate learner beyond technology to understand impacting business and law.  Why?  Consider cloud:  intentional architects have to understand security, policy and possibly international law, scalability, SLAs, and be able to suggest and drive right-sized governance.  The intentional architect also has to be a historian and able to analyze contributions to technical debt as organizations look to refactor, redesign, in addition to building new.  \r\n\t\r\nIt is somewhat daunting for experienced architects to change the aperture and cultivate a polymath mindset that actively focuses on using their myriad skills to keep drive simplicity and embrace pragmatism.   The commitment to being an intentional architect will be key for success as we enter this next epoch.","created_at":"2017-01-30T03:03:15.196Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T03:03:15.196Z"}]},{"id":7973,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-12T22:53:54.608Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T20:03:43.796Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQd49Y_7Lh0","rating":25.5,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["development","communication","iteration","ideation","sketching","design"],"profile":{"name":"Rizwan Javaid","bio":"Rizwan is a User Experience Designer.

Sketching helps with brainstorming ideas, iterating through concepts, and communicating your ideas to others. Whether working individually or in a group, your ability to sketch helps take the abstract ideas out of heads and into the real world. If you’re not comfortable sketching then there is little chance that your ideas will stick with you, your team members, and even your clients. Don’t worry—the confidence you need to put your pen to paper and start to sketch is close at hand! With the addition of a few simple approaches to your daily routine, you too can harness the power of sketching. \r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n- Developers can sketch.\r\n- Understand the benefits of sketching and why it is important for developers\r\n- Learn specific techniques to power up your sketching skills\r\n- See the power of sketching firsthand by taking part in sketching activities\r\n\r\nCome prepared to do fun sketching activities in this hands-on talk so you can experience the power of sketching firsthand. \r\n","notes":"The goal of my talk is to help both designers and non-designers understand the power of sketching. Everyone has great ideas to share and the faster we get them out of our heads and into the physical world the quicker we can move forward. \r\n\r\nAgenda of my talk:\r\n\r\n- Talk about the power of sketching. \r\n- Comparison of two designers and how they approach sketching and what effects that has on their careers. \r\n- Tools needed to sketch. \r\n- Sketching Activities - I have the attendees do a few sketching activities to help them understand the power of sketching firsthand. (This has been a wild success at previous talks.)\r\nAfter each activity, I have the attendees discuss the sketches with each other to help them practice talking about their sketches.\r\n- Close out the talk by showing sketches from my 30-day sketching challenge and how it transformed my sketching skills.\r\n\r\nI want the attendees to understand that the transformation from a little bit or not at all sketching to harnessing the power of sketching is not a long time. All it takes is some consistency and effort.

As the biggest ecommerce company of the Netherlands and Belgium security risks grew exponentially. But it’s not scalable to let your security team grow with the same rate. That’s why we also focused on creating a security culture within the company: making security a responsibility of everyone, not only the security team.\r\n\r\nTo not only create this culture in IT but also in the rest of the company, we organized Abuser Story workshops for Product Owners and Business Analysts. Abuser stories are a fun way of thinking about the security of your new features. It triggers to think of unhappy flows, think of thresholds to monitor and so on. Making the systems Secure by Design, something really relevant for architects. We saw that Product Owners consulted the security team and architects way more for advice when designing new systems, they gave room and time to developers to write secure code, and discussions between the Security and development teams were actually constructive. It helped to get the “security, we are in this together” mindset. \r\n\r\nIn this talk Jim will tell the journey of bol.com, the growing importance of security, and the way we tried to cope with it in a fun way. The lessons learned are valuable for every (growing) company that struggles with making security scalable, and assuring that you will not only be secure today or tomorrow but also in 5-10 years.\r\n","notes":"Creating awareness in (IT) companies regarding security is becoming really important, and we saw that this awareness should extend way beyond IT.

Since it is more or less something I came up with myself I am very enthusiastic and passionate to talk about it. Especially since I experience the succes from it every day now in my projects.

I will try to answer your questions below and give some additional information.\r\n\r\nAbout what I will tell about how we embedded a security culture in the company:\r\nSo how do you already get that security mindset embedded in earlier stages. How do you get people excited to think about security? Security has the prejudice that it is boring, that is something you have to do, maybe because someone else says so. Like the security team/department. But security can also be fun! Fun? Yes! By stimulating the employees to think like a hacker, either technical or functional, they got motivated to think of security requirements by approaching it from the other side. This in combination with the right tools really helped to get our security level to high standards.\r\n\r\nSome more information about the Abuser Story Workshop:\r\nWith abuser stories we touch on a subject everybody worked with: user stories. Normally with user stories you define new functionality that you develop with the customer in mind. But how can this functionality be abused? We stimulate the colleagues creativity to think evil and create a hacker mindset for themselves. Turn it around: write an Abuser story: As a hacker, I want…, So that… We were surprised by the evilness of our colleagues – we had some real hackers among us. We do this by introducing a simple proces, let one team think about abuser stories (so how could you as a hacker abuse this functionality), and the other team about user stories on how to avoid abuse. After that the 'Attacking' team presents its abuser stories, which the other team needs to 'Defend' with one of their user stories. We then stimulate the Product Owners to braintorm about abuser stories at the kickoff of each new functionality, more or less facilitate their own workshop. The outcome is then translated in requirements for the different user stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are actually two ways of how you can approach this talk. \r\n\r\n1. A (comprehensive) talk about the journey of bol.com and how we embedded a security culture, where I will deep dive more in how we did this with the use of Abuser Story Workshops. This focusses more on how we created this security culture, and the lessons we learned from this proces.\r\n\r\n2. A short talk about the journey of bol.com and how we embedded a security culture, and facilitating a Abuser Story Workshop to illustrate how we did this. This focusses more on teaching you how you could facilitate these workshops yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\nRelevance for audience: the first is relevant for a broader audience, where the second talk (workshop form) is more relevant for Analysts and Product Owners.\r\n\r\nI hope this gives you more insights. If you have any questions or you want me to elaborate a bit more, just let me know.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJim","created_at":"2017-01-05T10:15:16.558Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T10:15:16.558Z"},{"id":3126,"submission_id":7384,"talk_id":14092,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks, Jim.

How does this fit with the incremental and iterative nature of agile methodologies? \r\n\r\nIn this session, I'll cover the following aspects: \r\n\r\n* Creating an architecture vision, including desired architectural qualities, during Sprint Zero \r\n* Identifying potential strategies for achieving the desired architectural qualities, without creating an ivory tower architecture\r\n* Prioritizing the architectural qualities and adding them to the Product Backlog along with the functional requirements \r\n* Implementing and verifying architectural qualities with the help of real stories from the Product Backlog.   \r\n\r\nI will take concrete examples from projects on how to apply the above concepts.","notes":"I have been in the IT industry for 32 years.

We want them to evolve with the needs of the business, its customers and stakeholders, and to be resilient in the face of ever changing market conditions and the external environment. This level of adaptability and responsiveness needs to be supported by the architecture of the systems we create. The complexity of the environment that architects find themselves in is increasing in recent years, with cloud, DevOps, continuous deployment, micro services and other elements adding to the factors that architects must consider. With this growing complexity, architects need to be supported by effective decision-making approaches.\r\n\r\nSize is also a factor. Larger systems and larger organizations have, by definition, a larger number of dependencies (internal and external) that must be managed, and a larger number of stakeholders (internal and external) whose needs must be addressed. The architecture of larger systems can involve hundreds or thousands of people, creating dozens to hundreds of products, components and subsystems that all need to work together. Maintaining the conceptual integrity of the architecture under such circumstances, and over time, presents many challenges and a greater need for coherence. \r\n\r\nTo navigate all of this, agile architects need to be adaptive; they need the ability to dynamically shift their decision-making approach to match the complexity of the circumstances they face. This session will describe how lessons from complexity science, and in particular, sense making and the Cynefin framework, can help architects to be more agile in how they work, and in turn, help them develop architectures that are more agile and adaptive to the needs of the organizations they serve.\r\n\r\n### Learning Outcomes\r\n* Applying sense making in the context of architecture\r\n* Applying the Cynefin framework to architecture problems and decisions\r\n* Examples of architecture problems and decisions that can be mapped to the different domains represented by the Cynefin framework (obvious, complicated, complex, chaotic and disorder)\r\n* How to manage the transition of architecture problems between these different domains\r\n* Implications for organization structure and communications\r\n* How such an approach leads to a more resilient architecture, and a more antifragile organization\r\n* How complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework supports emergent architecture\r\n* How complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework help the organization and the architecture to be more agile\r\n\r\n### Format\r\nFor a 90-minute workshop I typically use the following format. \r\n\r\nPart 1 (5 minutes):\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n* Overview of concepts\r\n\r\nPart 2 (10 minutes): \r\n\r\n* Architecture descriptions\r\n* Using narrative to understand architecture\r\n\r\nPart 3 (40 minutes):\r\n\r\n* Sense Making analysis of architectures and their influence on the organisation\r\n* Analysing the patterns that emerge from the sense making activity\r\n\r\nPart 4 (30 minutes):\r\n\r\n* The Cynefin Framework, and how it applies to architecture\r\n* Designing experiments\r\n\r\nPart 5 (5 minutes):\r\n\r\n* Debrief and wrap up\r\n\r\n","notes":"The majority of the session is highly participatory.

We can then relegate all interpretations of those events to subsystems that are easy to build, change, and replace when necessary. The resulting systems have single responsibilities and are decoupled from each other, which makes them simple to modify. Event Sourcing can enable us to move faster by supporting rapid experimentation with new perspectives, new user interactions, and new insights into our business.\r\n\r\nEvent Sourcing is agnostic of technology stack and language style, but it goes well with another pattern called CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation. In this talk, we will do a deep-dive into the two patterns and scope out a system that has:\r\n\r\n* Receiving and validating Commands that, if successful, result in Events (with pseudocode to illustrate how it might work).\r\n* Interpreting Events into denormalised projections for very fast reads.\r\n* Single responsibility services for reacting to Events by creating other events and, if necessary, triggering external behaviour.\r\n\r\nWe will also cover more in-depth topics, such as:\r\n\r\n* Strategies for evolving events and event schemas over time.\r\n* Dealing with eventual consistency.\r\n* Popular technologies for various system components, such as how to store and distribute events.","notes":"This is a 90 minute talk.

In my experience this happens for a few reasons:  architecture documentation is rejected as being too heavyweight, documentation is typically out of sight and out of mind, and many developers don't know what to document.  Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), a lightweight documentation approach [proposed by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), solves these problems by recording design decisions in a simple markdown template in the same repository as the code affected by the ADR.  In this talk we will share our experiences and lessons using ADRs over the past year while working on multiple projects for IBM Watson.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk you will be able to create effective ADRs, introduce them to your team, and avoid common pitfalls with the method.","notes":"This talk is intended to be a 30 minute experience report.  I can't figure out how to change the session type to match this.\r\n\r\nThe talk will have the following tentative outline.\r\n\r\n1. Introduction / Problem overview: teammates don't have architectural context, decisions aren't communicated and are lost over time\r\n   * Failed attempts to solve the problem -- wikis, dedicated repos, \"official\" documentation\r\n2. ADRs Overview\r\n   * Nygard's proposal\r\n   * Connection to other work and research\r\n3. How we use ADRs\r\n4. Exercise: Create an ADR (optional, may fall out depending on timing, at most this is a 5-7 minute exercise)\r\n5. Case Study: IBM Watson Information Retrieval Enhanced team\r\n   * This section will include the proposed lessons and tips for adopting and using ADRs based on our experiences\r\n   * Create a common template that everyone agrees to use\r\n       * examples from case study\r\n   * Identify an architecture champion to point out when architectural design decisions happen\r\n   * Add ADR creation tasks to the backlog\r\n   * Use pull requests and peer reviews to teach people how to record a decision and to\r\n       spread konwledge about decisions\r\n   * Use ADRs to grow architects on your team\r\n       * Creating an ADR is a small slice of design responsibility.  It turns out to be a great way to\r\n           infuse the team with architectural thinking and train new architects\r\n   * Store ADRs with the code\r\n   * Works great with microservices where small groups of people and the code\r\n       they create work autonomously within a light governance framework\r\n   * Revisit old ADRs every so often to update them and ensure you have accurate reflection of current thinking\r\n6. Problems we ran into with ADRs and are still working through\r\n   * Plain text diagramming is a pain point.\r\n   * ADRs emphasize architectural decisions for a single component.  This is great for smaller projects and\r\n      individual microservices but falls apart when multiple architectural components stored in multiple code\r\n      repositories are involved.\r\n      * Our solution was to create an \"Architecture\" repository, which stored ADRs that cut across multiple\r\n         architectural components, linking to refinement ADRs as appropriate.\r\n   * Overemphasis on design decisions at the expense of other design documentation\r\n       * The team became awesome at recording ADRs to the point where they wouldn't document anything else!\r\n       * ADRs were smashing success.  Complementary methods that are as simple and lightweight are needed for\r\n          design concepts other than decisions.  examples: alternatives, governance policies, general design guidance,\r\n          quality attribute scenarios and other architecturally significant requirements\r\n7. Conclusion\r\n   * closing thoughts on using ADRs as a way to \"sneak in\" architecture\r\n   * great way to create a history of the project and explain not only where we are but how the system arrived at this point\r\n   * Show where ADRs fit as part of an documentation strategy \r\n   * Links to additional resources","abstract":"Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture key architectural design decisions in a lightweight, easy-to-create, plain text template stored in your existing version control system.

I am familiar with the Tyree/Ackermann paper.  I actually [referenced the same paper as a comment on the blog](http://disq.us/p/18d4i4r) about 8 months ago in an attempt to point out the same thing!  We also include a link to Nygard's blog and that paper in our ADR template as background information.\r\n\r\nI am certainly planning to make this connection in the talk, if accepted.  The two templates have the same goal in the end but collect slightly different information.  The ADR is significantly simpler, if nothing else.  I think a key difference and the thing that is kind of unique about Nygard's approach is in what is done with this information.  It sounds simple, but storing the design decisions in the version control system acted almost as a stealth way of injecting some of the ideas from Views and Beyond into the team.  What's more a small ecosystem of tools has sprung up around ADRs.  See https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools and https://github.com/holytshirt/dotnet-adr as examples.\r\n\r\nFinally, Thougtworks recently [classified ADRs as \"trial\" methodology](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records).

I first encountered the importance of maintaining Architectural Decisions ass a part of the SEI Views and Beyond book. I have been a great advocate and have used them ever since. I think its an important technique that needs good attention and would help many Architects attending the conference. The approach of understanding software architecture in terms of a variety of architecture decisions is now widely recognized.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do have a suggestion. Instead of the talk just focusing on ADR as suggested by Michael Nygard, what would be even useful is discussing the approaching of Documenting Architecture Decisions as a whole, which decisions to document and not, the payback/benefits and the variants available for documenting them along with your case study.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am concerned about the idea of just storing the Architecture Decisions in isolation without many other significant Architectural Artifacts. I understand that the Thoughtworks seems to recommend including them in the “trial” methodology. However, I am just concerned with the misnomer that these are the only set of significant artifacts for all cases. Could the details be presented more on the lines of Evolutionary Architecture.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-04T06:17:59.216Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T06:17:59.216Z"},{"id":3066,"submission_id":7391,"talk_id":14103,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Yogeshwar, thanks for your feedback!\r\n\r\nI share your concerns and plan to address them in the talk.  I mentioned the points you raise under section 6.  I am certainly not suggesting this is the only set of artifacts required and recognize this is a trap teams easily fall into -- one of my teams did!\r\n\r\nWith respect to deciding when to document a decision vs. not, I plan to cover that under 5.4 and 5.5.  It turns out that people don't always know or recognize when an architectural decision has been made.  Pull requests and explicit architecture tasks combined with pairing was how we worked through some of those issues, in addition to including clear guidance in our template.  Basically we created situations for on the job training over time.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to attempt to place this technique within the context of the broader literature, as you suggest.  As you also point out, the idea of recording decisions is not new and is a commonly understood good practice.  The point of this talk is not to retread old ground but to look at good practice from the perspective of a newer method that people actually use and seems to resonate well with developers.  These ideas have been around for a while, and yet few teams practice them.  Why?  I think this method is another incremental step in the right direction.  By the end of the talk people will be armed with the knowledge they need to be successful with the method, not just try it out.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMichael","created_at":"2017-01-04T14:17:27.098Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T14:17:27.098Z"},{"id":3075,"submission_id":7391,"talk_id":14103,"user":{"name":"Yogeshwar Srikrishnan","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33bed537dc2a17123b3491737913e0a9?s=500","email":"yoga80@yahoo.com"},"body":"Thanks for the detail!

The updates do help to answer my questions, but it does leave me with a couple of concerns.\r\n\r\nThe first is still regarding the the claim: \"Deploy any application to any environment using any tool-set – for free.\" \r\n\r\nWhen you say \"free\" do you mean free of licensing cost, or free of the cost of \"the operational and technology overhead.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim that it is free of licencing cost is valid, with a few caveats.  The tools being integrated are free of charge and Electric Cloud can be free for up to 10 community hosts.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not so sure about the claim regarding overhead costs.  As you say earlier in the submission: \"the operational and technology overhead of orchestrating the hand-offs from one tool to the next in the process are not without cost.\"  The later claim that you\r\n\r\nDoes electric cloud eliminate costs for ANY tool, or only the tools for which a plug-in already exists?   What about tools that do not have an existing plug-in?  \r\n\r\nMy second concern is that the presentation feels like product demonstration.  It appears to introduce the problem of overhead costs for automation and orchestration and then present Electric Cloud as the solution to that problem.\r\n\r\nThe audience of Architects would like to go deeper than that.  They would be interested in seeing how Electric Cloud is solving this problem.  What are the underlying patterns and principles adopted by Electric Cloud in order to reduce the total cost of ownership for software delivery pipelines?\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\n\r\nGed","created_at":"2017-01-04T08:44:18.442Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T08:44:18.442Z"},{"id":3097,"submission_id":7179,"talk_id":13725,"user":{"name":"Avantika Mathur","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7991eeae861b2945ebb8ebaca2f54d2e?s=500","email":"oheel@catapultpr-ir.com"},"body":"Hi Ged -\r\n\r\nHopefully these help answer some of your questions: \r\n\r\n1.

This covers areas such as integration (how do I get data into / out of the blockchain), analytics (how do I gain insight into the data held by the blockchain?), and APIs (providing managed access to a blockchain within an enterprise).\r\n- Recommendations on how to get started\r\n\r\nI also weave a couple of demonstrations into the flow, just to show what a blockchain \"looks like\" (e.g. what does a smart contract look like, how does an integration technology tie into a blockchain).  The session is geared towards \"beginners\", so this particular talk does not get into the \"low-level\" details of the code.\r\n\r\nThis talk can also fit into a 30 minute session if that would work better for the agenda.

Regarding the hands-on techniques for visualizations - I use a blend of storymapping with domain modeling to focus on 'what architecture when'.  I also use a simple quadrant that weighs architectural impacts on cost of being wrong and ease of change to talk considerations that might move more decisions to be lower cost / easier to swap (though not always the case).\r\n\r\nWhere this gets into micro services and cloud computing is using these - namely storymapping - to drive domains for services and inject some chaos thinking into cloud computing - if this service were to go down, what is the impact on the product and what should it be?  What is the cost.  \r\n\r\nI delivered a similar talk a few months back at Surge Conference in DC though it was an hour - the video was posted, but they have revved their site for the 2017 conference and I cannot find it a direct link to it.

We also use chaos as a way of exploring the map and product constraints.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps, please keep firing away with any other questions or if you would like to see any particular changes.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJoel","created_at":"2017-01-25T04:40:23.328Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T04:40:23.328Z"},{"id":3692,"submission_id":8165,"talk_id":15517,"user":{"name":"Joel Tosi","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a575aa486aa37fcb5cab5646110f721a?s=500","email":"joel.p.tosi@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Thijmen,\r\n    Let me know if the slides helped at all.

I agree this is an important topic for organizations that want to move to continuous deployment, especially when their systems use shared databases. Database changes are not handled directly by Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. You need something else tool-wise. \r\nIn our organization we are using Flyway. One of the challenges we are facing is that the DBAs lose operational control over table schemas. That's less of a problem if each system (or microservice) has its own dedicated database. But in many enterprise IT environments, there's still some centralization of database changes. Continuous delivery/deployment with Flyway (or similar) will typically ask developers to author DDL statements that will eventually be automatically executed in production upon system initialization. I hope your presentation will touch on this aspect.","created_at":"2017-02-07T12:19:33.147Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T12:19:33.147Z"}]},{"id":7834,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-10T14:52:26.339Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:07:54.622Z","additional_info":"Links for Presentations\r\n\r\nAWS Reinvent 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbLhfiXVP6Q&index=2&list=PLz79c1Qow_bW8DdjJKRtIRngqKEArQ4Rm\r\n\r\nServerless Conf London Oct 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-w6a9rcy8&index=1&list=PLz79c1Qow_bW8DdjJKRtIRngqKEArQ4Rm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlog by authors\r\n\r\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/microservice-delivery-with-amazon-ecs-and-application-load-balancers/\r\nhttps://developer.capitalone.com/blog-post/delivering-microservices-for-enterprise-with-devops/\r\n\r\n","rating":100.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["cloud resiliency serverless","30-min tech talk"],"profile":{"name":"Sathiya Shunmugasundaram","bio":"Sathiya has been working in IT for the last 20 years.

Please find more information you have asked for below.\r\n\r\nWhat is your definition of chaos engineering?\r\n\r\nIn our definition, Chaos Engineering is a discipline where we will simulate real world failures which occur rarely and cause catastrophic losses to the systems. This is much more important in cloud environments where we have completely relinquished the infrastructure management and high level service management to the cloud provider. Traditional testing mechanisms do not cover such self inflicted failures. Using Chaos Engineering tools, applications can subject themselves to failures and measure their resiliency.\r\n\r\nHow do you commonly work with teams to improve their microservices?\r\n\r\nAs part of integration and performance testing of applications, we engage them and set them up with cloud detour, the chaos engineering tool. The application teams can then start registering various failures against the application and infrastructure. For example random termination of servers and high CPU simulation affecting the processes. This will help evaluate how the microservice performed against the failures and if it still met the NFRs.\r\n\r\nhow generally applicable the solution you use at Capital One is or whether it is highly specific to your needs\r\n\r\nThe solution is very generic for applications deployed in AWS. Any AWS deployed application will be able to use the various aspects of solution whether the application just uses Infrastructure services like EC2 or higher level application services like ECS/S3\r\n\r\nAdditional information on AWS and general availability\r\n\r\nThe tool received a great feedback in its initial pilot and currently being aggressively adopted by various divisions. Over next few months, we will be able to make it Open Source ready for the community use. Also one of our objectives is to build an abstraction layer over the capabilities and make it available in other cloud providers like Azure and Google cloud. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSathiya \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-22T03:04:34.247Z","updated_at":"2017-01-22T03:04:34.247Z"},{"id":4264,"submission_id":7834,"talk_id":14873,"user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Sathiya,\r\nThanks for your submission. I have a couple of suggestions: \r\n\r\n1. Your talk description does not mention automation anywhere. A conference participant who's not familiar with Chaos Monkey or \"chaos engineering\" may wonder if the approach being described is fully automated (on one end) or is about a strategy to \"manually\" engineer scenarios to test resiliency. Since today we pursue the \"automation of all things\", I think the description should say to what degree the solution uses automation and integrates to CI.\r\n\r\n2. You mention mission critical applications, but don't qualify the applications any further. You could be more specific in the description. For example, the solution may work for failure testing of services that expose http endpoints, but not for failure testing of services that consume JMS messages. \r\n","created_at":"2017-02-06T14:08:37.828Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T14:08:37.828Z"},{"id":4381,"submission_id":7834,"talk_id":14873,"user":{"name":"Sathiya Shunmugasundaram","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17dc934bfd849e2c5ee19de1cac59009?s=500","email":"sathiya.shunmugasundaram@capitalone.com"},"body":"Paulo - Great feedback, thank you.

From small devices to houses, the IoT is leading more and more things into the digital fold every day.  Sensors are necessary to turn billions of objects into data-generating “things” that can report on their status, and in some cases, interact with their environment.  At the moment, cities are at a crossroads where they must choose to either use or lose the transformative potential of big data. Advances in AI and the widespread availability of sensors have provided us with powerful applications that allow us to perform daily tasks by analyzing the huge amount of data.  The insights to be gained from data are endless.  In the light of this a new paradigm of combining AI and IoT has emerged, in which the quality of life could be increased through the use of big data and cloud technology.

We treat connectors as self-contained, physical (i.e. binary), identifiable special-purpose components that isolate interfaces from communicating components. We intentionally place interfaces contained in connectors in the forefront of any kind of component system. \r\n\r\nThrough interfaces in connectors, components can be supplied with extra-functional services, such as the monitoring and budgeting of system-resource usage, the profiling of architecturally relevant components, and the checking of communication protocols. These services are beneficial for industrial systems that are maintained and evolve in the field. Connectors are a means of realizing blue/green deployments, canary releases, and performance monitors; all of which are necessary for DevOps scenarios that work in industrial environments. Connectors take over these tasks. Components can focus on their core businesses.\r\n\r\nEven without any extra-functional services, connectors provide two significant advantages to the development and operation of resource-constrained, safety-critical embedded systems. Firstly, connectors physically decouple communicating components, in the sense that components depend on (reference) connectors but connectors do not depend on components. Secondly, for implementation connectors do not need heavyweight component frameworks or middleware as usually in distributed systems.\r\n\r\nConnectors can be built for and operated in rich runtime environments such as .NET CLR, and in thin runtime environments such as crt0 for C++ programs. Basically, for our purposes, build and runtime environments need only to support interfaces in the sense of the identically named language concept and linkable compilation units. To build connectors of different kinds, we use several techniques and design patterns of different pattern languages in various combinations, for example Factory, Strategy and Decorator from E. Gamma et al., Registry from M. Fowler, Bounded Context from E. Evans and Insulation from J. Lakos.\r\n\r\nThe presentation is divided into four parts. In the first part we introduce the minimal connector and explain the consequences and benefits for developing, testing and configuring component systems. In the second part we develop the minimal connector into light connectors containing plain interfaces (call and callback) and then into heavy connectors with additional extra-functional services. In the third part we apply connectors for structuring a system whose development follows the DevOps methodology. In the fourth and final part, with a better understanding of our motivation, objectives, nature, assemblage and application of connectors in our practice, we work out similarities and differences in comparison with the Interceptor pattern from D. Schmidt et al. and component-and-connector views (SEI: Documenting Software Architectures, 2nd ed.).","notes":"","abstract":"Physically independent connectors decouple components without performance costs.

I have a few comments on specific assertions you make in the talk description. \r\n\r\n1. \"We view software architectures as systems of connectors.\"  Well, architecture is more than that. The literature on software architecture today is clear to say that software architecture encompasses multiple *views* (or perspectives, viewpoints). An architecture view that shows the components (runtime elements) and connectors is one of them. But a view that describes, for example, how the source code is organized in layers, or packages, namespaces is also part of the software architecture. A view that shows how different components are allocated to different hardware elements or nodes is also part of the software architecture. A view that shows the data entities and their relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many) in a data centric information system is also part of the software architecture. So, I think this statement should be more flexible to say something like \"An important perspective of any software architecture is the one that shows a system of connectors.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"A connector is a self-contained, physical (i.e. binary), identifiable special-purpose component that isolates interfaces from communicating components.\"  There are overloaded definitions of components and connectors out there. I particularly like the ones in \"Documenting Software Architectures, Second Edition\". This book says a \"Components are the principal computational elements and data stores that execute in a system.\"  Then it says \"A connector is a runtime pathway of interaction between two or more components.\"  The book makes clear that connectors are first-class citizens in the software architecture. But your definition seems too strict. For example, when a Javascript web page (the client component) makes an http call to a REST service (the server component), I see the http communication as the connector. However, in my architecture I don't have a physical, binary, identifiable element for that connector.  I also find it confusing to say that a connector is a (type of) component. Conceptually, it's easier to separate components from connectors.\r\n\r\n3. \"Connectors are a means of realizing blue/green deployments, canary releases, and performance monitors\". Often times, performance monitoring, logging, and other similar functionalities are performed by interceptors. An interceptor is not a connector, it's a special type of component. It's special because it is not called directly, it does not have a visible interface; instead, the interceptor will \"listen\" to the communication and will intercept messages/calls/events of interest. In the example I mentioned (JS component talking to a REST service), an interceptor could intercept the http calls for monitoring, logging, routing, message transformation, security controls. \r\n\r\n4. \"Firstly, connectors physically decouple communicating components, in the sense that components depend on connectors but connectors do not depend on components.\"  The level of coupling actually varies based on the type of connector. For example, an EJB client component will use the EJB-specific RPC connector to call the EJB component. That EJB client is tightly coupled to the EJB. OTOH, if a Java component sends a message to a JMS queue and there is another Java component that consumes messages from that queue, these two components are indeed decoupled because of the presence of the message queue connector. \r\n\r\n5. \"In the third part we apply connectors for structuring a system whose development follows the DevOps methodology.\"  I'm thinking much of what you call connectors is actually about interceptors. A DevOps strategy asks for health and performance monitoring that is visible to Devs as well as Ops. Much of that functionality is achieved by interceptors often provided by tools such as API gateways, zabbix, etc. \r\n\r\nI'm being picky wrt the use of core architecture concepts, but your talk seems pretty sound and valuable. \r\n","created_at":"2017-02-07T12:53:05.916Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T12:53:05.916Z"},{"id":4392,"submission_id":8138,"talk_id":15470,"user":{"name":"Joachim Fröhlich, Florian Krautwurm, Markus Lachenmayr","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f17b85f0f3df832a3bfbce052a9e3ce8?s=500","email":"florian.krautwurm@gmail.com"},"body":"Dear Paulo,\r\n\r\nthank you for your valuable feedback.\r\n\r\nWhile not able to address all your points, we have improved the talk description, in particular regarding connectors and the interceptor pattern.\r\n\r\nWe focus indeed on physical connectors, first-class citizens in the software architecture. Reduced to the minimum, a connector in our practice only contains one or more related interfaces (types) without implementations, and a somewhat special factory.\r\nAs the name suggests, interfaces are between components. Interfaces do not belong to the components communicating through interfaces, locally or remotely, sequentially or in parallel.

Architecture validations are becoming part of the processes used by IT groups to ensure software quality, and architecture review knowledge, reference materials and trained resources are becoming increasingly available. \r\nContinuous customer feedback is the best way to validate a software product and indirectly its architecture. Unfortunately, the system needs to be fully delivered in order to get that valuable feedback, and the cost of adjusting a software architecture after the system has been delivered is usually very high. The objective of the architecture validation techniques we describe in this presentation is to ensure that the future system meets its business objectives and quality attribute requirements, without slowing down the pace of delivery associated with Continuous Delivery.\r\nArchitecture validations deal with far more than just the technical issues, since business drivers are a key force in shaping an architecture. One of the key benefits of continuous architecture validations is that they periodically review the relations between business goals and architecture. As a result, they ensure that the system is designed, built and delivered in a way that provides the greatest benefit for its stakeholders.\r\nThis presentation describes how our approach can be leveraged to validate architectures in any type of project, and especially in a Continuous Delivery project.  First we define what we mean by Architecture Validation. Then we focus  on when to conduct Architecture Validations. We then discuss the roles required in an Architecture Validation. We finally detail how we can conduct architecture validations by describing some industry recognized techniques such as questionnaire-driven approaches, scenario-based approaches (including SEI's ATAM) and decision-based approaches (such as DCAM).\r\nIn order to illustrate the concepts introduced in this presentation, we will use a real-life example of Continuous Architecture Validation, showing how various approaches can be combined to effectively validate a project.","notes":"Murat Erder (Deutsche Bank, London) will be a co-presenter. This presentation builds upon our presentation on Continuous Architecture at SATURN 2016, and is the result of significant research and practical and extensive experience in this field. Further details can be found in our \"Continuous Architecture\" book (Morgan Kaufman, Nov 2015), and especially in Chapter 6 of that book.\r\n     \r\nThe tentative outline of the presentation would be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction: Why do we need to continuously validate the architecture? ***Note: this section will introduce a case study which will be used throughout the presentation to illustrate the concepts \r\n \r\n2.

Or is it possible to achieve conceptual integrity with a distributed architect (and if so, what is the key)?\r\n\r\nThank you.

In this talk I discuss integrity on several levels: \r\n\r\nFirst, not all of the alternatives I present are actually a departure from persons or small groups driving the architecture. \"Marshalls\" are typically accountable for a cross-cutting concern spanning the whole system or big parts of it. They look after integrity in architectural approaches assotiated with security, performance or recurring technical problems with infrastructure etc. So the classic architect is splitted, but not in a functional fashion as the system itsself.\r\nAlso the approach of an architecture owner encapsulates important topics in one person. In this case it is a person with general overview, experience and a broad vision. He is more of a mentor and rises important topics. He isn't the one who decides and designs everything though. This is mapped to a team where he has the same possibilities and tools as everyone else. Conceptual Integrity is an important driver for him though. \r\nOnly one of the presented options goes without a person or team explicitly and foremost responsible for the architecture. \r\n\r\nSecond, the integrity of a system has big advantages in productivity, maintainability and derivatively in reliability, security and so on. Nevertheless it comes at a cost and many modern systems see conceptual integrity as a scale, where the maximum is not the ultimate goal. We could for instance define a minimum of common ground that works for a given project. Could be the deployment model, the general structure, the monitoring and security approaches and some interface standards. Inside these general rules a team could in fact develop solutions that are structured very differently and possibly use other technologies than other teams of the same project. Of course this poses problems in reusability and the other areas stated, on the other hand the teams can act on their own and usually deliver value faster. If the architectural drivers and the context allow it, a little less integrity could be optimal for a project.\r\n\r\nThird, even without an architect that predefines approaches and tactics we were able to achieve a good level of architectural integrity. Integrity is driven by a good engineering process, broad architectural knowledge, experimenting developers and some kind of \"natural selection process\". This selection process includes that good solutions are broadcasted to all teams and their adaptation is made easier. Bad ideas or the divergence from a known best practice should be harder to implement. In the acstract I call that \"low viscosity design\". Architecture then focuses on the identification of good approaches, the support of their communication and the creation of space to abstract good solutions and make them more universal. This is another form of architectural work as the \"standards-first\" approach, with arguably lower conceptual integrity, but often faster innovation, better flexibility and more realistic architectural concepts. A combination of top-down and bottom-up architectural approaches is a good fit for most projects I work on, low viscosity can shift the boundary a little in the bottom-up direction without causing direct chaos.\r\n\r\nAll of these topics are introduced in this talk, not all of them are covered in great detail. I am open to shifting the focus of the talk a bit if certain aspects sound very interesting for you. The 90min version will have a deeper look and also an exercise on some veto-mechanisms we use to broaden the accountability but not lessen the influence of good architects.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nStefan","created_at":"2017-01-31T15:20:11.449Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T15:20:11.449Z"},{"id":4436,"submission_id":8183,"talk_id":15549,"user":{"name":"Stefan Toth","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/09f421cbcb8ddf7506526e1096672630?s=500","email":"stefan.toth@embarc.de"},"body":"Thank you for accepting my talk for SATURN 2017!

While there is some work in this field, most of it has been devoted to metrics and estimates. Metrics are shadows of snowflakes, and thus not particularly informative when seeking to understand the purpose of a system or the behavior of a component. Improving estimation, while an interesting application and a laudable goal, likewise does not directly help developers create better software faster, nor manage the growing complexity of real-world systems. Can we apply ML in ways that help guide development, inform software archaeology, and reduce effort for developers? If so, can these things help us take on the systems-of-systems-of-systems of the future, where million-line code bases will be considered \"quaint\"?\r\nAfter a brief survey of existing/past work in the area, we'll investigate the question of \"what does software look like\", examine the more interesting question of \"what does good software look like\", and use these insights to explore how we can enable developers to create and manage ever-larger software systems. No ML experience or math required. Lots of pretty pictures.\r\n","notes":"I've been research the applications of AI/ML/DL to software development, and experimenting with some unique approaches specifically intended to aid software developers, including the notion of 'semantic drift' (the 'distance' between classes and stories in semantic space) and topic-based clustering of software subsystems as a guide to refactoring.

How many devs, how many ops, number of applications/microservices involved, size of the infrastructure. \r\n\r\n2. SATURN has a diverse international crowd. Please consider using more generic terms instead of PHI and PII. Likewise, you may add a short sentence that clarifies how big is UPMC. Many attendees will not know it's one of the largest health care organizations in the US. \r\n\r\n3. In the Notes, you say \"in this initiative we leveraged packages provided by several vendors (Amazon, Microsoft, Dell, and others) and open source software such as GitHub, Artifactory, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes.\" I think you should move that sentence to the Description, which will be visible to conference participants, and will catch their attention. \r\n\r\n4. I hope you will talk about lessons learned, things that worked and things that didn't work. \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6.

Our architecture pattern languages have changed as have our development, deployment, and operating procedures (DevOps).  \r\n\r\nDuring this transition, one source of ideas has been the functional programming community.  Functional programming itself mostly happens within a module and indeed many software architects treat it as an implementation choice, unrelated to architecture.  But it turns out that some ideas from the FP community are helpful in architectural design: statelessness, immutability, and pure functions.  They underlie DevOps practices and are at the core of many distributed systems patterns at the core of our architectures.\r\n\r\n## Why now?  \r\nFunctional programming ideas have been around for a long time but conditions are ripe.\r\n\r\n1.  Coping strategy for complexity.  As systems get bigger but our brains stay the same size, we invent tech to cope.  Statelessness, immutability, and pure functions make it easier to reason about how a system behaves.\r\n2.  Problems grew in size.  No single computer big enough to run a system.  FP ideas suited to parallelism and concurrency, so many smaller computers can solve big problems.\r\n3.  We have more money than sense.  You can buy 100 cloud machines for less than one junior developer.  So why not do Continuous Integration with every source code commit?  Why not have a farm of servers running different versions of your code during deployments?  Why not burn RAM with immutable data structures?\r\n\r\n## Functional ideas in modern architectures\r\n\r\n1. Client-side.  Reactive patterns and frameworks.  Eg React, CycleJS, Elm.\r\n2. Server-side.  So-called \"serverless\" pure functions.  REST architectural style.  Reactive services.  Event queues between services.\r\n3. Persistence.  Append-only datastores.  Event sourcing & Command Query Response Segregation (CQRS).\r\n4.

If you haven't been staying current, this talk should give you a mental map to start your learning.  If you have stayed current, this talk should reveal how functional ideas weave throughout modern web architectures and perhaps provide insight into why they work.\r\n\r\nThe talk surveys how modern web systems are built with FP patterns.  It will dig into one client-side example and show how FP ideas can simplify this task.","notes":"I propose this as a 30-minute tech talk.  I can scale the material to fit into 22 mins + questions.\r\n\r\nI have plenty of material so I'm happy to do a 90-minute tech talk that digs into more details if you think the topic is sufficiently interesting.  90-minute slots are rare at SATURN, so I don't want to presume.  \r\n\r\nIf you think 90 minutes is better than 30, please consider this as a participatory session.  If the audience is really new to FP ideas, it can take time to see how to accomplish work using these patterns.  There is a great game we could play a few rounds of ([Cube Composer](http://david-peter.de/cube-composer)) to warm them up (go ahead and try it now).  Then we could design a system using event queues and discuss the quality attribute tradeoffs, or go further into the UI reactive example.","abstract":"Functional programming (FP) has invaded architectures.

I have a few suggestions/comments from the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program: \r\n\r\n1. One may look at the description and ask: 'Sounds promising. But we use scrum/agile development in a low ceremony way. Would this work for me?'  So, is this approach applicable to Agile development? With small co-located teams and short sprints? \r\n\r\n2. If I had to guess, I'd say that profiling the jobs and pains of the customers takes time and requires some modeling and documentation effort. My feeling from experience is that developers will not be very keen on doing that. How much automation can be employed in this process? How long does it take? Is it hours in facilitated meeting with stakeholders like in  QAW or ATAM?\r\n\r\n3. I see the value of the approach for companies that sell software products or products with software. Would it be equally attractive to enterprise IT?

SATURN is also an architecture conference, so some planning effort should be ok.\r\n\r\n2.

I work both with products and enterprise IT, so I believe I understand your concern. Yet enterprise IT also has customers, the business.

Leveraging this and other AWS services, it has become possible to build entire business applications in a secure, scalable fashion, without provisioning VMs or taking on the system administration tasks that entails. There has since been quite a bit of buzz around 'Serverless' development, with entire frameworks and tooling built to support such an approach. This talk is intended to discuss what the tradeoffs of taking such an approach are, how to technically execute on such an approach within AWS, and what my own experiences have been in building and running Serverless applications in production.","notes":"90 minutes\r\n\r\nAs the backend tech lead at Stanley Black and Decker I have led the development and deployment of multiple applications into production that rely entirely on Serverless backends, along with a hybrid legacy app that we are currently moving toward being Serverless. \r\n\r\nI intend to cover the basics of building REST interfaces on top of the AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda, delve into the tradeoffs of doing so, and then branch out into methods and considerations of data storage, access control (including authorization/authentication of users to your REST endpoints and other resources), continuous integration and development, messaging patterns (both solely on the backend, and between the backend and various user clients), backend generated events and triggers (i.e., responding to scheduled events, or building in logic to trigger additional behaviors outside of the context of a user request), and various best practices and considerations I've learned from my experiences.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this talk I will touch on the place of the following AWS services in a Serverless solution - Lambda, API Gateway, S3, Dynamo, RDS, Elasticache, IAM, Cognito, STS, SQS, SNS, IoT, CloudFormations, Cloudfront, Route 53.\r\n\r\nThe intended presentation mechanism is predominantly slides, with links to code and Cloudformations to illustrate less obvious implementation strategies  (i.e., not \"here's how to write a record to DynamoDB\", which is easily gleaned from API documents, but \"here's code demonstrating the usage of the AWS IoT platform as a websocket for sending arbitrary messages across\", or \"here's an example Cloudformation for setting up an existing lambda to execute periodically, and to include a dead letter queue to report errors to\". In general, my goal is not to give an end to end working example of everything I discuss (as that will be impossible to go over in detail in the time frame, and will be exceptionally contrived), but instead to go over enough to give people a high degree of confidence in speccing out their own projects, while also providing code or walk through an example for anything that did not strike me as inherently obvious on how to implement from glancing at AWS' documentation. \r\n\r\nTentative high level outline - \r\n\r\n1. API Gateway and Lambda - demonstrate a Serverless endpoint, wherein we can see arbitrary code execution in response to an HTTP POST, in the context of a Lambda, which simply parrots back the body and one or two headers, to show how they can be mapped into the function. Discuss using the API Gateway as a passthrough to an existing REST API, to allow for the swapping out, endpoint by endpoint, to a serverless one, in the event of a legacy app.\r\n\r\n2. Data storage options - largely high level discussion of considerations between Elasticache, DynamoDB, and S3 as storage mechanisms, in terms of cost, ease of use, and availability/consistency guarantees.\r\n\r\n3. Backend processing and user notification - Discuss lambda event sources and their implications (the ability to trigger lambdas from writes to Dynamo or S3, a brief foray into SQS as a distributed queue, and how things can fail, and what to do about them). Demonstrate using AWS IoT for websocket pushes to web clients (and mention GCM and APNS as still being available for pushing to mobile). Discuss SNS as an option to broadcast events to custom HTTP endpoints, or to send emails, as well as a possible way to send mobile push messages.\r\n\r\n4. Access Control - Discuss Cognito as an Amazon provided identity provider. Demonstrate how to go from a Cognito identity (or a custom identity, if using custom code to log someone in) to a set of temporary AWS credentials, that can be used to access resources. A brief foray into IAM policies (which control what a set of AWS credentials have access to). And how to leverage both IAM and AWS credentials to properly secure one's own REST API endpoints.\r\n\r\n5. CI/CD - Discuss some of the frameworks for developing and deploying serverless code to AWS. Demonstrate an example using the Serverless (http://www.serverless.com/) framework. Demonstrate Cloudformations as a way to define and port infrastructure between environments. Suggest the use of AWS Config and Cloudtrail to track changes. \r\n\r\n6. Monitoring - Dive into Cloudwatch. Demonstrate executing lambdas, navigating the resulting logs, exporting to S3 for ingesting into another tool. Demonstrate available metrics, and how to set up alarms. Discuss integration points with tools we've used.\r\n\r\n7. Latency and Cloudfront- Discuss latency of lambdas. How real it is, how to mitigate it, when to cache. Demonstrate setting up a Cloudfront instance in front of custom API, and when to use it vs the API Gateway's cache. \r\n\r\n","abstract":"This talk is to introduce Serverless computing, a new paradigm in the cloud for deploying applications that requires no server administration, and which scales transparently in both function and cost.

One can build REST interfaces for enterprise systems on-premises for the intranet, without AWS Lambda or API Gateway.

In the notes you say \"I intend to cover the basics of building REST interfaces.\" Do you mean REST API design? That's a quite large topic on its own.  \r\n\r\n3. In addition to benefits, I think you should also discuss the challenges and drawbacks of serverless architecture. Such discussion flows naturally into motivation for and risks associated with serverless. \r\n\r\n4. A 90-minute long talk takes the time equivalent to 3 30-minute talks, so the info should be clearly valuable. Serverless is a hot topic this year and many people want to know what it is, if it's a good fit for them, what's the roadmap to 'go serverless'. I think your talk goes over all of that. Do you intend to talk about serverless outside AWS? For example, simple use of MBaaS for mobile app authentication?  \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6. What is \"event pipelining\"? Is there a more commonly used equivalent term? Maybe a term that's in wikipedia?  :^)\r\n\r\n7. Just to clarify, what's the presentation mechanics? Slide-based presentation end-to-end? Or do you plan  to have a demo? Or is it a tutorial where participants will actually use their laptops to play with the technology? \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T19:04:36.959Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T19:04:36.959Z"},{"id":3757,"submission_id":8090,"talk_id":15375,"user":{"name":"Christopher Phillips","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ee258f073df1844949be0ce18d5926dd?s=500","email":"lostcolony@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks so much for your input!

This is different from the well-known [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) (Implemented for C++ in [[1]](https://github.com/actor-framework) and [[2]](http://www.theron-library.com/index.php)), which uses private state and peer-to-peer messaging, and is closer in spirit to the [Flux application architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview.html#content) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), with its single dispatcher and its unidirectional data flow.\r\n\r\nOur data model is suitable for high performance and complicated algorithmic flows, where multiple threads require access to shared objects. We have implemented it in C++, and used it successfully as the application framework for the [iTero intra-oral Scanner](http://www.itero.com/en) (See demos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_kYPyjUtbU) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWuNPt33tho))\r\n\r\n###Our architecture is based on the following principles:\r\n\r\n1. All shared state is immutable and reference-counted\r\n1. Each actor keeps a lightweight snapshot of the state, which consists of references to shared immutable objects\r\n1. Actor snapshots are eventually consistent\r\n1. Actors communicate using [Publish-Subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)\r\n1. A single dispatch function is used for publishing both events and data updates\r\n1. Persistence, replay, undo and application logging are handled by generic mechanisms\r\n1. Objects can be marked as *invalidated*, allowing immediate, out-of-band signaling and cancellation of long-running computations","notes":"##Primary track\r\n\r\nI propose this talk for the track **\"Development Tools, Frameworks, Techniques, and Patterns\"**, because it introduces a new framework while referring to existing frameworks and patterns - the Actors model, Flux and Redux. The talk will be highly technical, with diagrams, code and a demonstration video. \r\n\r\n##Session type\r\n\r\nThis talk falls in the category of **\"Technical Talks and Tutorials\"** or **\"Experience Report Presentation\"** (30 minutes), because it is a highly technical presentation, based on my own experience and knowledge. The architecture framework I shall describe in the talk is one that I pioneered and developed, and it forms the basis for the application that drives the [iTero Element](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdI5Pp2dVTg), a leading 3D intra-oral scanner for dentistry and orthodontics. The iTero software was developed under my technical leadership, as a chief architect and lead of the algorithms group. \r\n\r\n\r\n##About me\r\n\r\nI have a Ph.D. in mathematics, and plenty of experience giving lectures. I have given 14 talks in international math conferences, including 2 Siggraph talks ([Siggraph 2006](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1141990), [Siggraph 1999](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=311541)). After 15 years of leading algorithms teams, I decided 4 years ago to become a software architect. Since then, I got a Software Architecture Professional Certification from SEI, and I have been constantly studying and teaching various domains of software engineering.\r\n\r\nI am highly passionate about software architecture, and I love teaching software engineering and mentoring developers, as well as coding in multiple programming languages.

Present the challenge we faced\r\n  - Show video and give a description of the [iTero intra-oral Scanner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdI5Pp2dVTg)\r\n  - Explain the data model we use in earlier versions of iTero, and why it was inadequate for the new product\r\n 1. Present the basics of the architecture\r\n  - Define an \"Actor\"\r\n  - Explain how actors access data and communicate via a dispatcher: All of the shared state is made of immutable data, and any modification is done by creating a new object, and broadcasting it\r\n  - Explain the data model (each actor keeps a key-value dictionary, where the key-space is shared, and the values are pointers to reference-counted objects in the heap)\r\n  - Explain about publish-subscribe and event handlers\r\n 1. Explain how this architecture is different from the famous Actors Model\r\n  - Provide links to existing implementations [1](https://github.com/actor-framework), [2](http://www.theron-library.com/index.php).\r\n  - Explain how our model is based on shared state and publish-subscribe, while the Actors model is using private state and peer-to-peer messaging.\r\n 1. Discuss more aspects of the architecture\r\n  - Separation of concerns: Actors are responsible for message-passing and fetching data from the shared state, and they delegate computations to other objects that are tested in isolation\r\n  - How an actor is created: the role of the dispatcher in making sure that a newly created actor has access to the most up-to-date state\r\n  - A generic solution for persistence\r\n  - Cancellation of long-running operations\r\n  - Generic logging\r\n  - A generic Record/Replay feature\r\n 1. Discuss design trade-offs, and pros & cons of the architecture\r\n  - Pros: Safe concurrency, and ease of implementing complex logic\r\n  - Cons: Data model is flattened into a key-value dictionary, losing a natural hierarchy\r\n 1. Shortly discuss a possible improvement of the data model\r\n  - Use a persistent tree structure (as in [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)), instead of a flat key-value store, to restore the natural hierarchy of objects.","abstract":"We present a battle-proven architecture for lock-free concurrency control in multi-threaded C++ applications.

Actors and actor systems are an important architectural pattern that have been around for a while but seem to have gained more traction in the past few years with the rise of frameworks such as Akka and an increase in distributed systems.  I like that this talk explores a hybrid pattern that combines actors, pub-sub, and peer-to-peer.

What is the rationale behind the design decisions that were made?\r\n* Sections 4 and 5 could use some tightening.  I like the discussion of trade-offs but section 4 seems like a general bucket of ideas.  If accepted please think about how this section can be organized to better convey your message.\r\n\r\nOne thing to think about: one are the top 2 or 3 things that someone who attends your talk should be able to do that they couldn't do before?

This requires multiple threads to access large amounts of shared data for generating scans, refining them, repositioning them, rendering them and storing them to persistent storage - all simultaneously. This is why we chose to design a system where shared state can be accessed safely by collaborating threads. Pub-Sub was chosen because of the high complexity and the data-driven nature of the design (e.g. rendering is triggered when an object is changed, without the producer of the object having to communicate with the rendering actor; denoising and filtering algorithms are triggered when a new scan is created; etc...). Do you think this clarifies the motivation?\r\n\r\nIn answer to your comment about sections 4 & 5, I think I'll tighten this discussion by removing a couple of items from section 4 (the first two, probably), and incorporating the rest of them into the trade-offs discussion, showing how these aspects are added benefits: For example, the pub-sub nature, together with the dispatcher, enables a generic record/replay feature (like in Redux), and similarly, generic solutions for persistence and logging.\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees be able to do that they couldn't do before? They will be able to implement a data model that supports efficient and safe sharing of memory in a multi-threaded application. This is useful for complex systems. Also, they will learn the benefits of channeling all writes through a single thread (dispatcher), which provides total ordering of messages, and is one way of ensuring consistency in concurrent systems.\r\n\r\nWIth kind regards,\r\n\r\nAdi.","created_at":"2017-02-06T06:43:08.489Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T06:43:08.489Z"}]},{"id":7302,"state":"accepted","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2016-12-24T11:51:28.259Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T22:30:45.175Z","additional_info":"I have plenty of speaking experience, but, unfortunately, no video.","rating":100.0,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["communication","leadership","influence"],"profile":{"name":"Adi Levin","bio":"I'm a software developer, architect and mathematician.

An architect needs to form collaborations with different teams, often with different styles of working and planning, in order to clarify the project's scope and requirements, and then design the architecture and implement it.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, an architect needs to use all communication tools effectively: Meetings, architecture drawings, written documentation, design reviews, code reviews and informal conversations. In every opportunity, an architect should encourage the engagement of other stakeholders and must learn how to deal effectively with their concerns, and, in particular, how to deal with opposition and with conflict.\r\n\r\nBut communication techniques and technical excellence combined are not sufficient for sustainable effective leadership. To gain trust and credibility, one has to display consistent personal values and character ethics, and build relationships that are based on integrity and commitment.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share with you my own experiences and lessons learned from years of working as a software architect in a global organization, and from studying dozens of the greatest writings from the field of business, leadership and communication.","notes":"##Primary track\r\n\r\nI propose this talk for the track **\"Other topics of interest\"**, since the lessons learned here are applicable to a wide range of circumstances, and are not related to any technology or software trend.\r\n\r\n##Session type\r\n\r\nThis talk falls into the category of **\"Experience Report Presentation\"** (30 minutes, describing first-hand experiences and lessons learned). It is entirely based on my own experience, and the lessons I have learned in the past 4 years working in a global organization, gaining the trust and cooperation of stakeholders of all kinds.\r\n\r\n##About me\r\n\r\nI have a Ph.D. in mathematics and plenty of experience giving lectures. I have given 14 talks in international math conferences, including 2 Siggraph talks ([Siggraph 2006](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1141990), [Siggraph 1999](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=311541)). After 15 years of leading algorithms teams, I decided to become a software architect, 4 years ago. Since then, I got a Software Architecture Professional Certification from SEI, and I have been constantly studying and teaching various domains of software engineering. In addition, I have spent numerous hours studying the literature on leadership, personal growth, effective communication and influence, and I have successfully applied the techniques and principles to my work.\r\n\r\nThis will be my first talk in an international conference on software architecture. I created this talk after years of successful technical leadership in a global organization, gaining credibility with many people from remote locations and from various disciplines, in domains where I was often not an expert.\r\n\r\nI am also the submitter of a second talk, with the title **High-Performance Multi-Threaded Immutable Store for C++**.\r\n\r\n##Main theme\r\n\r\n***Collaboration is power; Be genuinely interested in the concerns and challenges of others; Include them generously; Act with integrity***\r\n\r\nAll of the stories, insights, and tips that I share have the above theme in common. For example: When talking about effective online meetings, I share how useful it is to reflect people's concerns in writing and in real-time, as a way to verify that their concerns are understood correctly, and to give them the feeling that they have been heard; When naming components, I recommend to include others in choosing their names, as a way to encourage their collaboration; For dealing with opposition, I recommend to focus on a better understanding of the opposing party; On dealing with difficulties, I emphasize that this is the time to make extra efforts and display personal integrity, by being there for the developers, and by admitting and correcting one's own mistakes.\r\n\r\nWhile those messages are all relevant to any leadership situation, I believe they are especially useful for software architects, whose effectiveness relies upon their ability to form a collaboration, often without the benefit of a position of authority.\r\n\r\n##Talk outline\r\n\r\nThe talk will be filled with personal stories and examples from my own experience. The audience will be given a set of techniques that anyone can implement and principles that anyone can follow.\r\n\r\n1. Challenges facing a software architect (based on my own experience):\r\n  * Remote teams\r\n  * Some teams not communicating well with one another\r\n  * Teams not used to working with a designated software architect\r\n  * Stakeholders from very different time zones\r\n  * Different cultures of different teams; different levels of agility\r\n  * Poorly documented legacy systems that need to evolve\r\n  * Different opinions about whether to build or to buy\r\n  * Unclear project scope\r\n  * Unclear requirements\r\n  * Stakeholders with prior commitments, who don’t have time to spend on your project\r\n  * Tasks that require designing a kind of system that you have never designed before\r\n1. How to recognize that you have influence?\r\n  * Your designs come to life\r\n  * People ask for your advice on various projects outside your area of responsibility\r\n  * People want you to help them resolve disagreements\r\n  * People tend to accept what you propose\r\n  * People are copying your documentation style\r\n  * People welcome your participation in meetings on any topic\r\n1. Effective meetings (especially remote meetings)\r\n  * Different kinds of meetings require smaller or larger groups\r\n  * Declare the goal of a meeting\r\n  * Publish agenda and slides up-front\r\n  * Phrase questions to be answered during the meeting\r\n  * Capture people's comments and opinions in writing and display in real-time them during the meeting\r\n  * Finish in time, and share meeting notes with people\r\n1. Effective architecture views to bring out the essence of an architecture\r\n  * Depending on the audience, it is often better to present a simple and concise drawing, as opposed to complete sets of architecture views\r\n  * Define names of components/modules/classes and their responsibilities. The other things follow from that. \r\n  * Naming something is an act of leadership. Declaring the name that someone else chose is even stronger. \r\n1. Use written documentation - this is especially important in a big and global organization\r\n  * Writing is hard for people, so there’s an opportunity to stand out here\r\n  * Make information accessible\r\n  * Become the source of information by summarizing it better than others do\r\n1. Encourage the engagement of others\r\n  * Seek the subject matter experts and do 1:1 discussions with them\r\n  * Look for opportunities to incorporate the ideas of others. If you accept someone’s idea, they will be more understanding next time you reject one of their ideas. \r\n  * Look for opportunities to show honest appreciation to other people’s contribution\r\n1. Dealing with opposition, rejections and unknowns\r\n  * If someone opposes an idea, ask questions about it - don’t just insist - regardless of how strongly you feel about your solution\r\n  * Never get attached to a design. Recognize that there are multiple solutions and analyze both the benefits and the cost of any design decision\r\n  * Seek first to understand, and only then to be understood \r\n  * When it is not clear how to make progress, phrase specific questions to be answered and ask for people's help\r\n1. Build personal relationships with stakeholders\r\n  * Get to know people on a personal level\r\n  * Seek opportunities to show your appreciation\r\n1. Be there for developers, after handing off the design to them\r\n  * There will be unanswered questions and difficulties\r\n  * Be there in weekly meetings and sprint planning\r\n  * Notice the conversations between teams, and help where it's needed\r\n1.

If you need to shorten the presentation, I suggest dropping or shortening topics 1, 3, and 8. \r\n\r\nThis sentence is not OK to me: \"Depending on the audience, it is often better to present a simple and concise drawing, as opposed to complete sets of architecture views.\"  Here's how I think (based on \"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition\"): \r\n- a software architecture is described as a set of architecture views. There isn't a single diagram that shows everything.\r\n- you should only create an architecture view if it has clear value to stakeholders (the audience for the software architecture).\r\n- a given architecture view may consist of a simple and concise drawing. \r\n\r\nThe following sentence is not clear to me: \"Declaring the name that someone else chose is even stronger.\"\r\n\r\nIn the talk outline, item (4) recommends: \"Define names of components/modules/classes and their responsibilities. The other things follow from that.\"\r\nI think having expressive names for software elements is important, but that recommendation alone is not very helpful. In fact, item (4) is about effective architecture views and there are so many important recommendations under this topic, such as:\r\n- Use a notation key in your diagrams (or indicate what standard notation you're using).\r\n- Use different symbols for different types of elements and relations. \r\n- Use consistent symbology across diagrams. \r\n- If you're using a pattern in your design, name it. If the reader is familiar with the pattern, he/she will understand the design more easily.\r\n- Use a template (standard organization) for your documentation. In particular, use the same template for all architecture views. (Subsections in a template may be N/A of course.)\r\n- Keep the information up-to-date. If you can't update the documentation, discard, archive or mark it as out-of-date.\r\n- Complement structural diagrams (e.g., UML class diagram) with behavior diagrams (e.g., UML sequence diagram).\r\n- Record the rationale for important design decisions.\r\n- Avoid ambiguity; write from the reader's point of view; review the documentation. \r\nThese recommendations can be found in the book I mentioned above (\"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition\").\r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n- Notes: \"trust and cooperation of *of* stakeholders\"\r\n- Notes: \"Capture people’s comments *opinions* in writing \"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-04T18:57:06.728Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T18:57:06.728Z"},{"id":3090,"submission_id":7302,"talk_id":13936,"user":{"name":"Adi Levin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1cc0aaebe6a196f253e61d0454edf59?s=500","email":"adi.4694252@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks for the thorough review, Paulo. I am going to use it to improve the presentation, and I am taking this opportunity to clarify my proposal.\r\n\r\nMy emphasis in this presentation will be on the human relations aspects and how they affect the level of influence of a software architect. \r\n\r\nYour comments about the architectural views are correct, and I should rephrase my intent: All of the architectural views are important for reasoning about a system's structure. I am not presenting a different theory of documenting software architecture, but I am commenting about the way in which I would present those architectural views to different stakeholders. In presentations, we often don't have time to go through all of the views; also, we may do it in a more constrained environment of online remote meetings, so we need to focus on the things that yield the most understanding and buy-in from the stakeholders. \r\n\r\nIn this context, I claim that naming and stating the responsibilities of a component or a module, is of especially high value.  The list of responsibilities is a concise representation of the intent of the designer, which helps stakeholders review the architecture and ask good questions about it (e.g. \"if this component is only responsible for X, then how come it depends on Y\"?).\r\n\r\nOne way to make the most out of architectural discussions is to find opportunities where other people contribute. A very powerful application of this is when we name software elements. By asking someone else: \"How would you name this component?\" and accepting the name that they offer, we make them our partners in the project. Similarly, if someone proposes a modification and we accept it, we gain more of their their cooperation, and it will be wise to give credit to the contributors. \r\n\r\nMy plan is to share other insights of this kind. This complements the more technical aspects of analysis, design and documentation, with wisdom that comes from the realm of leadership, effective communication and personal growth, and I have lots of relevant stories from my personal experience, which I think will be highly beneficial to the audience.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I will need to shorten some of the topics - and I will shorten topics 1 & 3, as your proposed. As for topic #8, this is one I would like to emphasize, because my main point is how personal relationships make a difference.\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\n\r\nAdi.","created_at":"2017-01-05T13:46:42.669Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T13:46:42.669Z"},{"id":3091,"submission_id":7302,"talk_id":13936,"user":{"name":"Adi Levin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1cc0aaebe6a196f253e61d0454edf59?s=500","email":"adi.4694252@gmail.com"},"body":"Paulo - I also fixed the two typos you indicated.

Thanks for the kind words and for your review.\r\n\r\nHere is my context: I have been leading, and am still leading the technical design of a number of projects:\r\n\r\n1. An application for a 3D intra-oral scanner (http://www.itero.com/en) - there were ~20 developers working on it, divided to 4 teams in two locations (Israel and Moscow). Made of C++, C#, high performance algorithms and 3D graphics, interacting with proprietary hardware and real-time components.\r\n\r\n2. A HIPAA-compliant, scalable and highly available cloud-based storage system distributed in multiple data centers with integrations to ~10 applications. Involves ~6 development teams from 4 locations (East coast, West coast, Israel and Moscow), and other stakeholders from 3 more locations. Made of Java, NoSQL database, public cloud storage, REST API, caching layers, custom replication and workflow management, and a challenging data migration and transition strategy.\r\n\r\n3. A scalable and highly available cloud-based architecture for enhancing web applications by server-side algorithms, with interactive-rate messaging between the web page and the dedicated server-side process. Involves 3 teams from 2 locations + stakeholders from 2 more locations. Made of Java, Websocket, REST, elastic cloud-based cluster, with fully automated deployments.\r\n\r\n4. (Currently in early stages:) A cloud-based service for capturing, storing, displaying and manipulating doctor prescriptions. Emphasizes modifiability. Made of React, Java REST API, and document-oriented DB in the cloud.\r\n\r\nI am also involved in multiple other projects related to identity management & authentication, cloud-based workflow management, storage, data analytics, cluster computations, and others.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nRegarding your main feedback: You're right - my presentation should focus on a few key messages. I think those will be:\r\n\r\n1) Ways to get other people more engaged - this includes effective meetings, especially long-distance on-line conference calls, in which I have plenty of experience and success. For example, I want to demonstrate how I capture and display people's comments in real-time, and how satisfying this is to the participants: They know they are understood, and they know their opinion is heard, even when it is not accepted; Another example is getting people involved in the early stages of giving names to components.\r\n\r\n2) Ways to deal with difficulty and opposition: being open to others' ideas; listening, and truly caring about the concerns of others; not being attached to a specific solution, and being ready to challenge your own ideas; This doesn't mean giving up on good design solutions: It means that you should be willing to explain both the advantages and the trade-offs in the design, not in order to defend it at all cost, but in order to truly search for the best solution, thereby laying the foundation for better collaboration in the future, regardless of whose opinion ends up being accepted.\r\n\r\n3) Building long-term credibility. \"They don't care how much you know until they know how much you care\" - show commitment by being there when things are not clear, by allocating time for review and demo sessions; by providing specific feedback on detailed design decisions; by being there when teams disagree and need someone to resolve the dispute; by showing the appreciation and giving credit generously to others; And by admitting and correcting your design mistakes as soon as those come up.\r\n\r\nI will also give useful references to literature, where people can learn more about influence & leadership.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOn a personal note: I attended Saturn 3 years ago. It was one of the best conferences I have ever attended, and I still remember some of the great presentations (Especially the keynotes by Dianne Marsh and Joe Justice; The course by Robert Wojcik; Scott Hanselman's great talk; And others...). I will be honored and deeply excited to be among this excellent group of speakers.\r\n\r\nThis talk is not finalized yet. I have so many stories and references to share. I am planning to use the reviewers' feedback, and to do my absolute best to make this a great presentation worthy of the high level of this conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-07T18:29:55.807Z","updated_at":"2017-01-07T18:29:55.807Z"},{"id":3633,"submission_id":7302,"talk_id":13936,"user":{"name":"Anthony Tsakiris","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/646a039dcf3a2c4434f8fdf6c962b902?s=500","email":"adt2@speakeasy.net"},"body":"Thank you for your submission.

This presentation suggests a simple process you can follow to perform a rapid assessment of any software architecture effort regardless of its size, complexity or stage of development. The focus is on capturing the most critical aspects of the software architecture including: (a) Software Quality Attributes; (b) Key Architectural Decisions (including hardware platforms, software technology, development tools and reuse strategy); and (c) Architectural Design (primarily in the form of Unified Modeling Language or UML). Emphasis is placed on identifying and documenting references to existing artifacts. It generally requires an interview with the most knowledgeable software engineer on the proposal, development or maintenance team to identify the location of artifacts that are available and information that has never been documented. This is basically a two-day process. On the first day information is gathered and quickly recorded. On the second day, the information is analyzed, expert opinion(s) formulated, and a report is prepared and disseminated to all of the relevant Stakeholders. The process is a simple and straightforward mechanism for capturing software architecture and rapidly performing a valuable assessment during any time in the lifecycle of the product.

Growing an Architect's Community - My Journey","description":"Passionate individuals and businesses both try to create successful Communities of Practice (CoPs) for myriad reasons from honest desire to networking to a financially driven goal of sharpening worker skills. Why do some well-funded effort fail while rag-tag start-ups succeed?  In this session, hear the story of my struggles and successes  to grow a networked community of architects that now stretches across the globe.   There is no single formula to creating a successful community.  If you've got passion and take the time to really ask \"Why?\", your journey is starting off on the right foot!   Choose vision driven techniques over old-school mechanics to jumpstart new groups or resurrect ailing ones.  Attendees will talk away energized and ready to try a few of the techniques that worked  including:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sowing the seeds – Organic communities, whether jump started by a corporation or a hobbyist, tend to have the greatest growth and staying power.  How and where to sow community seeds positions a community for possible success.\r\n</li>\r\n<li> What are the success attributes of a boom? – How to define success and using qualitative and quantitative measures to detect a bust.</li>\r\n<li>Value, Brand, and Localization – Communities thrive when there is ownership at all levels and pride.  Understand how value definition impact a community’s charter and how building a brand provides community members with a sense of empowerment and worth.</li>\r\n<li>Agile concepts for community leadership – Transparency, communication, and continual evaluation/reprioritization of next steps can situate community leaders to react nimbly to change and protect community health.</li>\r\n</ul>","notes":"When I joined Deloitte Consulting, there was a rag-tag group occasionally sending out an email newsletter that went straight into everyone's trash.

I've won multiple national and global awards from Deloitte around my community building approaches.  Interestingly, the journey includes needing to pivot and find ways to engage those smart millennials.   Learning Outcomes: Participants will walk away energized with ideas for organizing and nurturing successful architecture communities:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Techniques to sowing organic growth </li>\r\n<li>How to defining success attributes and what are associated measurement techniques</li>\r\n<li>The impact of top-down support versus and bottom-up drive </li>\r\n<li>Principles for defining value and brand for a community; understand the impact of localization on a community or chapter</li>\r\n<li>Suggestions on applying agile techniques at the leadership level</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n","abstract":"Growing a community is tougher than it looks!

The involved systems fulfill valid purposes in their own right, can operate separately and are managed for their own purpose rather than the purposes of the whole.\r\n\r\nAllocation of business functions to specific system components and definition of interfaces with significant consequences for architecture of such large and complex IT and software system-of-systems (SoS) is a challenge. It requires data supporting decision criteria and accommodating fast evolution of the architecture in the agile organization.  \r\n\r\nRoche Customized Method of Architecting SoS \r\n===========================================\r\n\r\nFor the architecting of the system-of-systems in Roche product context a customized method was defined based on the US Department of Defense Architecture Framework.\r\n\r\nThis method involves 6 steps with start/finish criteria and deliverables for each. I will illustrate these steps using examples from Roche.\r\n\r\n1.  Business process Domain Analysis (identification of Business Drivers, Business Capabilities, Business Functions, Constraints, elaboration of User Stories and Workflows, definition of Quality Attributes).\r\n\r\n2.  Integrated Dynamic Modeling (IDM) for multiple workflows within the business process.\r\n\r\n3.  Derivation of Events, Activities and Resources for each workflow IDM.\r\n\r\n4.  Alignment to elaborate Common Events, Common Activities and Common Resources for all modelled workflows.\r\n\r\n5.

Architecting of data, process, deployment, … models and preliminary design of interface between the involved systems.  Verification of Quality Attributes fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThis method can be applied in agile projects, if the sprints are oriented on implementation of workflow.\r\n\r\nResults of application of the method at Roche\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\nThe customized method for the architecting of system-of-systems was applied to business processes related to Remote Solutions and IoT.

I have a few suggestions/comments from the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program: \r\n\r\n1. You say \"million connection points\" to characterize a large scale system. Would there be a different metrics unit people are more familiar with? LOC maybe? \r\n\r\n2. I hope you use examples to explain each of the steps. In fact, if you do so, I think you should say that in the description, that is, say something like... \"using real-life examples, I'll explain the 6 steps...\"\r\n\r\n3. One may look at the description and ask: 'Sounds promising. But we use scrum/agile development in a low ceremony way. Would this work for me?'  So, is this approach applicable to Agile development? With a small co-located team working on a single system and doing short sprints? If not, that's ok. If you see value, you may want to mention that in the description.\r\n\r\n3. If I had to guess, I'd say that some of these steps take time and require significant modeling and documentation effort. My feeling from experience is that developers will not be very keen on doing that. How much automation can be employed in the process? How long does it take? Is it hours in facilitated meetings with stakeholders like in QAW or ATAM?  Maybe the description can say something about the feasibility and cost required to use the process. \r\n\r\n4. The second paragraph is one long sentence. If you break it up it gets easier to parse.\r\n\r\n5. Just terminology: what you describe in step 1 as business process domain analysis seems to focus on functionality. To me that's business process modeling. To me domain analysis would necessarily encompass definition of business entities. An example of technique for domain analysis would be Eric Evans' DDD.  \r\n\r\n6. By the way, how are business capabilities different from business functions? If they're close enough, you can remove one to make the talk description shorter. \r\n\r\n\r\nTypo: \"and derived data*,* supporting the decision making ** and allocation \"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-30T12:37:09.362Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T12:37:09.362Z"},{"id":3932,"submission_id":7950,"talk_id":15115,"user":{"name":"Andrzej Knafel, Ph.D.","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ad6ad0b2d3de9e777d1f16d79c14132c?s=500","email":"andrzej.knafel@roche.com"},"body":"Hi Paulo\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your comments.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. I work in enterprise IT. In our organization, all new IT software projects now use microservices and docker, but more than half of the developers have not yet created anything in this new world. Many organizations are in a similar situation. I hope in your talk you make a reflection about what are the benefits of moving to microservices and containers, and what are the challenges and risks. Talks on this topic typically emphasize the good things, but often neglect to mention the difficulties. \r\n\r\n2. One of the topics is \"Tips for integrating containers into complex existing environments, supporting the hybrid state of microservices and monolithic applications.\" I hope you explain what would be the motivation and criteria to move existing complex monolithic application to containers. We have for the moment discarded that option in our organization because of cost and complexity. We have found it useful at times to take cuts of a monolith and repackage as containerized microservices that expose http endpoints though.\r\n\r\n3. Minor point... Your last topic is \"Putting an end to Shadow-IT.\"  Here's what wikipedia says about shadow IT: \"Shadow IT is a term often used to describe information-technology systems and solutions built and used inside organizations without explicit organizational approval. It is also used, along with the term 'Stealth IT', to describe solutions specified and deployed by departments other than the IT department.\" So, people using gmail instead of the corporate email system is \"shadow IT\", and I see how that's a problem. But it seems this derogatory term also applies to software applications developed by non-IT groups. Well, I think that's a great idea if put forth with some direction. My organization has had for years a successful program for decentralized software application development. Many end users now develop great solutions, and are given access to IT-managed databases when needed.  \r\n\r\n4. The term visibility is not clear to me in \"while ensuring visibility, security, governance and compliance\".\r\n\r\nTypo: \"recommended t*o*pologies and patterns\".\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T14:21:15.541Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T14:21:15.541Z"}]},{"id":8029,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-14T01:22:59.118Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:47:28.004Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":90.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["30-minute-talk","micro services architecture"],"profile":{"name":"Sairam Tadigadapa","bio":"\r\n\r\nI am a Director of Software Engineering at Capital One.

My focus in on Marketing and Decisioning Technologies. I am in their Richmond, VA location.  I lead a team of 70 engineers developing architecture, building APIs and devops platforms. Over the last couple of years we built several mission critical APIs most of them are for customer facing and highly regulated capabilities. We learnt a lot breaking a monolithic application into micro services. I led delivery of several enterprise APIs and deployed into production. Hope to share my experiences in the session. I will also have some time for questions and answers at the end. The talk should last for 30 min.\r\nI will be explaining the following success factors and considerations\r\n\r\nWhy did we go with micro services?\r\n\r\nThe initiative that I led was a regulatory project for Know Your Customer (KYC) regulation. It has very tight timelines and dependencies across the organization. The best way we could have accomplished the timelines is to go with a microservices architecture. So the business drivers for microservices architecture are\r\n\r\n- Ability to break the solution into manageable micro services and have small teams solve them. That increased the speed of development by taking advantage of public cloud, strong devops, and automated testing\r\n- To drive accountability and ownership in a cross enterprise initiative\r\n- We also wanted to break some capabilities away from a monolithic application that was getting difficult to change\r\n\r\nSo, it is the business imperatives that drove us towards the micro services architecture.\r\n\r\nIn general, if it is a differentiating capability for the business (say credit decisioning for a bank) and agility is important, microservices approach helps. If it is not a differentiating capability like payroll and HR, better stick to a vendor product.\r\n\r\nArchitecture:\r\n\r\n- When re-architecting a monolithic application, we achieved better success starting with the head (or customer facing functions) of the monolithic application. As we get deeper there will be more dependencies making it difficult to decompose the application.\r\n- It is important to Identify the business capability and design the contract accordingly. The architecture should be aligned with product owner and it should clearly articulate the problem the specific micro service is solving.\r\n- Use domain driven design as much as possible. It is important to define the domain and the bounded context for the micro service. This also helps to define the granularity of the micro service. If the service is too big, it replicates the monolithic. Maintainability and agility should be kept in mind while designing the micro service. Our definition of a bounded context was driven by the following:\r\n  - Autonomy of the domain, its business context, and self-contained data store without need for replication across microservices\r\n  - The domain is simple to explain\r\n  - In one instance performance dictated its domain. We separated a high performing calculation engine as its own microservice and developed it in GO language.\r\n- Architect should focus on the API contract, interplay of micro services, and ensuring the non-functional requirements are met. It is important for the architect to know where to stop in the design\r\n- What you design for real time may not work for batch. We first designed the microservices for real time first with a requirement of low throughput. But when we started using the microservices for batch use cases that had a higher throughput requirement, the infrastructure design did not work. So, we had to tune and scale up the microservices.\r\n- While building individual microservices was easy, orchestrating the services wasn&#39;t easy. We built Java orchestrations, but very soon the orchestration services became too big to manage. We are experimenting with reactive frameworks.\r\n\r\nDevops :\r\n\r\n- Benefit of micro services is speed of development. Unless the code migration and deployment is automated, it is difficult to manage a micro services factory\r\n- Automate integration testing and performance testing. We built automated testing for individual APIs, but did not build automated integration scripts. That became a bottleneck at the end as we had to do manual testing.\r\n- With micro services, there will be frequent release. Hence, doing blue green deployment helps to minimize the down time\r\n- A cloud first approach works better for micro services\r\n- ATDD is a mandatory practice for micro services\r\n\r\nBest practices and culture:\r\n\r\n- Encourage Small teams of 4-5. If a micro service takes more than 1-2 developer to understand fully, it is too big and will become unmanageable\r\n- Encourage pair programming\r\n- Encourage knowledge sharing. Leverage demos to ensure teams get the big picture. Otherwise, developers will know only their micro service and miss the big picture. We moved away from separate production support teams. Teams support what they build. When we deployed the microservices into production, initially it was difficult to support as developers did not have the entire architecture context.\r\n- With small teams, teams slowly have to graduate to full stack teams that can do everything the micro service needs.\r\n\r\nCommunication to stakeholders:\r\n\r\n- It is important to communicate to clients often and in detail. Write a blog and publish every detail\r\n- Version management is critical\r\n- Contract first design helps in better communication\r\n\r\nOther practical considerations\r\n\r\n- Level of granularity is very important. Be ready to redefine and re-architect often as you go along\r\n- It is impossible to have a separate support team to whom you hand off the micro- sevices after they are built. The eco system gets more complex for some other team to own manage. integrate support into delivery teams\r\n- Alerting and monitoring is extremely important. Automate to the extent delivery teams spend less than 10% of their time on production support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","abstract":"This talk will explain  lessons learnt with micro services architecture, what are the key success factors like cloud, devops, domain driven design, and the practical considerations like production support issues and increased complexity.\n","audience_level":"All","talk_format":"DEV@SATURN Talk (15 minutes)"},"ratings":[{"id":27153,"submission_id":8029,"value":100,"comments":"","created_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:18.406Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:18.406Z","user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"}},{"id":26820,"submission_id":8029,"value":100,"comments":"This looks like a great session based on experience at an established organisation, full of good advise","created_at":"2017-01-27T14:23:00.887Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T14:23:00.887Z","user":{"name":"Chris Cooper-Bland","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f238825a57dff36da715f337d78053ec?s=500","email":"ccb@badgerscroft.com"}},{"id":25470,"submission_id":8029,"value":50,"comments":"this looks like a great experience report with a lot of good advice.

Now for a proper review from me and not just a procedural comment.  \r\n\r\nI think lessons learned building microservices is a great topic and it's great to see that we, as a community, are getting a few more experience reports / case studies from teams who are actually using the patterns.  Things I like about this talk: there is a ton of good advice born from real experience covering a range of topic areas that all have to work to get microservices working.  Things I worry about with this talk: there are a ton of topics to cover in 30 minutes and some of it is common advice that has been around for a few years now.\r\n\r\nI generally like what you've proposed and appreciate the focus on lessons based on your experience.  My advice, if this talk is accepted, is to try to tighten the focus and reduce scope or to think about ways to \"chunk\" your advice for easier consumption.  Also think about how you'll reinforce your advice with examples from your experience.  Some of the bits you've included (e.g. how to version microservices and the stakeholders communication section) could easily be a 30 minute talk on their own!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMichael","created_at":"2017-01-17T14:21:20.906Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T14:21:20.906Z"},{"id":3346,"submission_id":8029,"talk_id":15249,"user":{"name":"Sairam Tadigadapa","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a5e942ea5ba423a74c096ead2641c67c?s=500","email":"sairam78@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks Michael.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. For reflection: not everybody who's creating microservices uses DDD. What's in DDD that helps to define the best size (actually, the most appropriate functional scope) for a microservice? \r\n\r\n2. Should all microservices match DDD BCs? \r\n\r\n3. What are the challenges of using microservices? Is microservice architecture the best option in all cases? If not, in what situations a more monolithic approach works better? \r\n\r\n4. It seems your lessons learned derive from redesigning (breaking up) a monolithic application into microservices. What's the motivation for doing that? In the organization I work for, new projects are using microservices. However, for the moment, we have discarded the option of redesigning monolithic applications into microservices because of cost and complexity. We have found it useful at times to take cuts of a monolith and repackage as containerized microservices that expose http endpoints though. \r\n\r\n5. You say \"Benefit of micro services is speed of development\". I don't disagree, but I hope you can explain why in your talk. As food for thought, I wrote a [blog post](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2015/11/microservices-beyond-the-hype-what-you-gain-and-what-you-lose.html) about benefits and challenges of microservices. There I argue why you can see improved modifiability with microservices, which is a factor for improving productivity.  \r\n\r\n6. I think the community is settling on a single word spelling for microservice. That's how it's spelled in wikipedia as well. :^)\r\n\r\nTypos: \r\n\r\n- \"more dependencies *that* make it difficult\"\r\n\r\n- \"It is important *to i*dentify the business\"\r\n\r\n- \"*The* architecture should be\"\r\n\r\n- \"ATDD is a mandatory *practice* for micro services\"\r\n\r\n- \"everything the micro service need*s*\"\r\n\r\n- \"Communication to stake**holders\"\r\n\r\n- \"Level of granularity is very important.* B*e ready to\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:11.242Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:11.242Z"},{"id":3738,"submission_id":8029,"talk_id":15249,"user":{"name":"Sairam Tadigadapa","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a5e942ea5ba423a74c096ead2641c67c?s=500","email":"sairam78@gmail.com"},"body":"Paulo,\r\nThank you very much feedback.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. The relation between agile development and architecture work has been examined and discussed for a decade. I'm curious to see your OODA approach. Indeed, I think you should name it in the talk description and make sure it is well described in the talk. \r\n\r\n2. As a sanity check, ask yourself if the approach works well for geographically distributed and/or outsourced teams. Also ask if it requires developers who are well versed in software design (in addition to architects who can code of course). \r\n\r\n3. Years ago I gave an interview to InfoQ. One of the questions was exactly about the topic of your talk. I'll reproduce here my answer. It's just food for thought for preparing your presentation...  \r\n\r\n\"It is a well known misconception that agile development means no documentation. In fact, as a [survey shows](http://www.ambysoft.com/surveys/modelingDocumentation2008.html), agile teams are more likely to model than traditional teams. A few things that agile architects (or perhaps any software architect) should remember: \r\n\r\nThe key aspect of design/modeling in agile projects is not to avoid designing, but to avoid \"big-design up-front\" (BDUF). In general, high-level architectural strategies should be worked out up front, but many design decisions and design details can be left to when you need them. \r\n\r\nOnly produce design documentation that will fulfill a need of the stakeholders. Stop designing as soon as you're ready to start coding. In the next sprint you can expand/refine the existing design as needed in order to capture design decisions required by next sprint's features. \r\n\r\nIf it's not worth updating the design, throw it away. Some design diagrams are used to guide implementation, but at the end the code sometimes looks different from the diagram. If you don't have time to update the diagram to reflect the implementation, it's better to remove it than keeping an out-of-date diagram that may confuse a future reader. \r\n\r\nMany times, sketches are all you need. Don't spend too much time crafting the neatest diagram using the latest and richest notation available. Don't spend too much money on sophisticated modeling tools if you just need a drawing tool. In many agile projects, especially the ones with small, co-located teams, the true value of design diagrams comes from drawing them, which forces you to think through the issues; once the issues are solved, the diagrams lose much of their value. Many times the design is represented as a sketch on a whiteboard or piece of paper. If the sketch can be used to successfully convey the design to the team, that sketch, as is, can be *the* diagram in your architecture view. Why not?\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T16:21:52.816Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T16:21:52.816Z"}]},{"id":7920,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-11T21:00:19.114Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:55:02.620Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":80.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["code-quality"],"profile":{"name":"G.

Cognitive Complexity solves the problem, and returns \"fair\" relative measurements of control flow complexity. \r\n\r\nIn this session, you'll learn what the Cognitive Complexity methodology is, and why you should add it to your metric suite, see how it applies to a number of code samples from open source projects on SonarQube.com, and learn how to use a method's Cognitive Complexity score as a guide to designing better code, and refactoring existing code to be simpler and, more maintainable. You'll also see that because there's no \"cost of entry\" / increment for methods, high class-level Cognitive Complexity is a reliable indicator that a class contains a lot of logic, not just a lot of methods. That is, you can use Cognitive Complexity to sift domain classes from the logic-intense classes that impose a higher maintenance burden.\r\n\r\nCognitive Complexity is already available as a new rule in some Sonar code analyzers, and should be available throughout the SonarQube ecosystem by the end of 2017.","notes":"30min Tech Talk\r\n\r\nSonarSource (the company behind [SonarQube](http://sonarqube.org)) is introducing a new way of measuring complexity: [Cognitive Complexity](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cognitive-complexity-because-testability-understandability/), which gives a far more accurate measurement of the relative understandability of a method than Cyclomatic Complexity. \r\n\r\nI'll cover these topics:\r\n* Cyclomatic Complexity: what it's good for and what's it's not, i.e. why a new standard/metric is needed\r\n* Cognitive Complexity: motivations, specifics, benefits\r\n* How to use Cognitive Complexity to guide refactoring.

I'm familiar with cyclomatic complexity, we use sonarqube in our organization, and we follow the \"automate all the things\" motto. I was reading the description and wondering if cognitive complexity could be something analyzable by sonarqube (or other static code analysis tool). When I read in the Description that in this talk I would learn a method to calculate a Cognitive Complexity score, then I imagined the worst: 'it's not automated yet.'  Only when I saw the notes I realized it's automated and, better yet, part of sonarqube. \r\nSo, my suggestion is to make clear in the Description that this approach is automated. I think you should also mention it will be part of the sonarqube ecosystem soon. \r\n\r\n- You may already be planning to, but I suggest clarifying whether cognitive complexity should replace or complement cyclomatic complexity analysis. In other words, in my quality index formula, should I use both, maybe with different weights?  \r\n\r\n- SATURN is focused on software architecture and different code analyses bring a lot of design insight.

In particular, a dependable CPS responds correctly and timely even in situations where system parts have failed, either temporarily or permanently. This requirement also applies when tests check reliability, availability and performance properties of these systems in the lab and in the field. A CPS with test probes built-into all HW/SW-components throughout the CPS lifecycle can fulfill these requirements. Applied to an eCar, non-intrusive, deterministic fault-injection tests executed by test probes provide strong evidence for statements like: “While driving, the eCar can safely be steered when a fault fails a central, redundant HW/SW component that executes steering operations”.\r\n\r\nTests of such systems and properties pose various challenges, for example (1) stimulating selected CPS parts with correct data and with faulty data in rare and critical situations, (2) checking selected CPS parts at selected points in time, or during time intervals according to focused and measurable test goals, (3) differentiation of the CPS's treatment of temporary and permanent faults, and (4) absolute non-disturbance of the tested system's functionality or timing. The fourth challenge applies in particular to fault-injection tests that check CPS safety, or that operate near the border between the CPS and the physical process.\r\n\r\nMeeting the challenges outlined above requires that the architecture of the system under evaluation be designed for testability. Starting from here, we first characterize the CPS we use as an example: an integration platform of an X-by-wire eCar (www.projekt-race.de/en). This motivates the need for reliable statements on the real-time behavior of the system from different tests, from which we derive testability requirements. Afterwards, we elaborate a series of design tactics that enable or improve the system’s testability, focusing on test probes. A test probe is a kind of Built-in Monitor (SEI: Testability tactic) or Maintenance Interface (R. Hanmer: Patterns for fault-tolerant systems) with particular demands in probe environments. When these demands are fulfilled, test probes can execute deterministic, efficient and reliable real-time tests, or act as safety monitors that observe and potentially intervene in a system.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the system domain you will learn two key aspects: how to design a testable system that incorporates test probes as central system elements, and how to write non-intrusive tests that yield reliable results.","notes":"","abstract":"We discuss the practical use of novel HW/SW test probes to non-intrusively check functional, performance, and safety properties in fault-tolerant cyber-physical systems.

Some call it the age of digitalization. No matter what you call it, we are harvesting more and more data about people and businesses. This data is then connected to other data and exposed as services which needs to be protected properly. As software architects, our primary security goal is to write secure software. Secure software has a technical aspect that is well covered (if not understood) in developer literature, but there is also a human and organizational aspect of security we as software architects must manage.  These aspects often go beyond the boundaries of the software development organization and are influenced by forces well beyond the company walls.\r\n\r\nOn the path to security there are a lot of trade-offs to be made, and some of these are made outside the IT organization. After working for more than 20 years in large organizations, I have found that there are certain signals that can be used to identify if you have a weak security culture. They do not necessarily identify security problems in themselves, but are indicators of topics that merit further investigation.\r\n\r\n__In this talk I will cover topics such as:__\r\n\r\n- Balancing prevention, detection and response\r\n- Leadership\r\n- Balancing Short term gains vs long time security impact\r\n- Handling security incidents\r\n- The importance of the curious mind\r\n- Communicating security concerns beyond the IT organization\r\n","notes":"__Note: This talk was originally submitted as a 30 minute talk.

We have seen that software architects e.g. need to understand the security culture of the infrastructure operations and systems operations organization.\r\n\r\nI will update and proofread if the talk is accepted.","created_at":"2017-01-25T09:30:11.789Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T09:30:11.789Z"},{"id":3739,"submission_id":8128,"talk_id":15451,"user":{"name":"Amine Chigani","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7188/Profile_Picture_S.jpg","email":"achigani@gmail.com"},"body":"FYI - Herald!

From our history of monolithic systems, then distributed systems, to Internet connected systems, we are now entering the era of cloud-hosted, microservice based, pay-for-usage system development. What does the history of software architecture tell us about the challenges of this new environment? And how does our approach to software architecture need to evolve in order to meet them?\r\n\r\nSoftware architecture has been a mainstream discipline since the 1990s and in that time has become a recognised, widely researched and often valued part of the software engineering process. However architecture approaches must reflect the technologies and priorities of the systems we are building and in this regard its future has never looked more uncertain or more exciting. \r\n\r\nFrom our history of monolithic compile time architecture, to many tiered distributed systems, to Internet connected services, we are now entering the era of cloud-hosted, microservice-based, pay-for-usage systems development. In this new world the boundaries of “my” system are no longer so clear and our systems are dissolving into complex webs of independently owned and evolved services, with nothing more in common than a shared credit card for billing and an agreement on the format of network requests. \r\n\r\nWhat can the history of software architecture tell us about the likely challenges in this environment? And how must it develop in order to meet them?\r\n","notes":"The genesis of this session was an invited talk at OOP2016, exploring the history of software architecture, which I developed into this much more practical talk aimed at working architects, for GOTO London 2016, where it went down well.

It has not been presented in the USA yet.\r\n\r\nThe talk at present is a slightly full 60 minutes and so I would suggest extending to 90 for SATURN which will simply involve using more examples and questions to the audience.

Based on the past 16 years of his life, there is no question about the genius of this kid; but not so much can be said about some of his entourage and followers. Missteps in his career threw shadows of doubt at times about his potential. However, as he matured and opened up to his parents’ wisdom and history, he’s been able to build a well-rounded experience that’s making him competitive for the next phase of his life.\r\n\r\nI wrote my first full-fledge program (app in today’s term) in the Spring of 2001, around the same time Mr. Agile moved into my neighborhood. I didn’t get to know him until early 2004 when his entourage grew into a dedicated community of fans and followers. Back then, I had one trusted mentor and an old friend, Mr. Architecture. Becoming friends with Mr. Agile was new and exciting but brought about challenges to my relationship with my old friend. Therefore, my growing up as a software professional was about learning how I could maintain friendships with both, reconciling their differences, and being better at what I do because of it.  \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I grow up in this kid’s world. So what does that look like? \r\n\r\nIn this DEV@SATURN talk, I’ll narrate the story about growing up as friends with Mr. Agile and Mr. Architecture. I don’t intend to indulge the “agile vs architecture” debate. On the contrary, I’ll annotate my story with examples from our journeys together, sharing experiences with some of Mr. Agile’s friends who advocated architecture sabotage, as well as situations where the outcomes were better because I had a foot in both camps and had won the internal struggle as to how to reconcile.\r\n\r\nCome join me in this talk as I’m sure you’ll find resemblances to your own journey. ","notes":"<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>\r\nThis talk is inspired by Linda Northrop’s keynote last year when she gestured a fist-bump to her chest, a sign of regret, about the stall/damage agile movement did to the progress of architecture adoption. It made me reflect on how I’ve lived the collision of these two worlds. \r\n\r\nAfter discussing an early version of this draft with her, I thought I should write and share my experience in the form of a TED@SATURN talk.\r\n\r\nMy starting thought was the fact that being close to agile movement from the beginning propelled my growth as a software professional, and my practice of software development have been better for it. However, this didn’t come without a struggle against an entourage littered with misunderstanding, incompetence, and lack of discipline.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, it’s clear that the agile pendulum swung too far in the beginning in a zeal to fix the ills of non-agile approaches. But like all physical pendulums, this one had to come back to equilibrium as agile original proponents began to realize that they overlooked some methodology-neutral principles key to developing quality software, including architectural principles.  \r\n\r\nThe punch line in this talk is that at this point agile is a reality. We are at a stage where we need to forgo the discussion about agile for agile sake OR architecture for architecture sake. We need to embrace this agile pendulum equilibrium in the making, and regain the role of those who think about appropriate practices, regardless of methodology, to build high quality software – Software that is fit for its intended use, where fitness has many dimensions beyond pure functionality. \r\n\r\nThe vehicle for me to deliver this is through storytelling based on my own software journey. I'll try to dig out old pictures to put in the background to color the scene.  \r\n\r\n<h1>TALK STRUCTURE (DRAFT)</h1>\r\nFor the purposes of this segment of SATURN, my talk will feature a storyline emphasizing a classic story ingredients.\r\n\r\n<h2>Origination</h2> \r\nYear 2001. \r\nA dozen or so smart software engineers with stellar backgrounds are holding a collective grudge against waterfall-like processes, titles, and roles. Like many revolutions, a manifesto is crafted in a mysteriously remote venue, and subsequently shared with the world: Baby agile is born. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, my induction into the world of software development occurs. A baby software developer is born. \r\n\r\nScene – we live in the same neighborhood. \r\n\r\n<h2>Building towards a crisis</h2> \r\nTime is going to flyby quickly here. \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In the ensuing 10 years, agile grows to garnish a movement that dominates all descending voices challenging it. It's cool; it’s the buzz; and it’s unstoppable.</li>\r\n<li>I meet Mr. Agile for the first time. I’m fascinated (anecdotal incidence here). I go running to my old friend, Mr. Architecture. He’s less fascinated. (I get to know why later). </li>\r\n<li>It turns out, architecture best practices (and a lot of common sense) are the colloquial baby that was thrown out with the bathwater. Architecture vs Agile debate begins to take place. </li>\r\n<li>This makes me extremely uncomfortable. I like both my old friend and my new friend but how can I hang out with them both?</li> \r\n<li>Affiliated agile revolutionaries weren't grounded as leaders in software engineering thereby resulting in a number of documented software atrocities. I witness some of these first hand in my neighborhood.</li>\r\n<li>Moment of truth: Agile is widely accepted but now the epiphany – It isn't the silver bullet after all. Adults in the neighborhood have been saying so all along but the wave was too noisy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Beginning of resolution</h2> \r\nIn the last five years, architectural thinking begins to permeate the conversation among agile leaders. Voices of reason, architecture and agile leaders together, have begun to take charge of the discourse again. They’re beginning to have serious conversations about the real software development challenges at hand with a common goal to build software in a way that is both flexible and sustainable.\r\n\r\nI’m getting really uncomfortable as I now get to go out and watch game with both my old and new friends. (Anecdotal incidence here). \r\n\r\nGreat headways are achieved but also challenges remain with a hopeful future – that of bringing our community together and embracing each other’s strengths.  \r\n\r\n<h2>Ending Monolog</h2>\r\nWhile I feel privileged to have grown up with this boy and met & learned from many of his clique, my work experiences led me to also work in many cases with the cronies. So I finish the story with a call to action for the audience to avoid the dichotomy of us versus them and to regain our role as the chaperons of quality as manifested in the end-products and artifacts regardless of the adopted software development methodology.  \r\n\r\nCurtain close. Audience cheers. Lights off. \r\n\r\n:)","abstract":"If Agile Manifesto were a boy, he'd be a high school junior today. Based on the past 16 years of his life, there's no question about his genius.

The role looks simple on paper: drive good, technical solutions to business problems. But with so much going on at any given moment and constant iteration, staying on top of and affecting outcomes across the board is practically impossible. If you can't even keep up, how can you find time to engage in the decision-making process?\r\n\r\nIn this environment, a 'command-and-control' style architect can encounter significant opposition and find themselves ineffective. Instead, we may consider exploring an entirely different approach. The Influential Architect is fusion of advisor, mentor, facilitator, communicator, and storyteller. As an Influential Architect, our aim is to improve outcomes across the organisation without the organisation becoming reliant on us making key decisions. To achieve this, we have to change the level of abstraction: where previously our purview has been decisions, we must now focus on people. When we can't be in every room where decisions are being made, we must affect the people who are and the process they use.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore what it means to be an Influential Architect, as well as some of the tools and techniques we can use to succeed. We'll cover:\r\n\r\n* Transparent Decision-making.\r\n    * How may we efficiently document and communicate our intentions with regards to technical solutions and what would those documents look like?\r\n    * How may we incorporate other development teams into our feedback cycle without creating bottlenecks?\r\n* The Light on the Hill.\r\n    * What is a technical vision and how does it help both the team and the wider organisation?\r\n    * How do we go about establishing a technical vision and who needs to be involved in this process?\r\n    * How do we hold teams accountable to technical visions, in order to ensure they work towards the same long-term goals?\r\n* Visual Storytelling.\r\n    * How can we effectively communicate technical outcomes to non-technical stakeholders?\r\n    * What are the key components of a good story and how does a story help communicate intentions?\r\n    * What does an example of a visual story that communicates a technical initiative look like?\r\n* Architectural Principles.\r\n    * What are architectural principles and why do we need them?\r\n    * How and in what format are architectural principles articulated?\r\n    * What does the process of establishing them look like to optimise for creating buy-in among technical teams?\r\n    * How may we hold teams accountable to the architectural principles we've established?\r\n* Sensible Defaults.\r\n    * How can we use sensible defaults to avoid reinventing the wheel while at the same time not hinder innovation?\r\n    * How do we go about establishing sensible defaults in an open and inclusive process?\r\n    * How do teams incorporate using sensible defaults in their work process?\r\n* Strategic Thinking.\r\n    * How can we champion long-term concerns in an iterative agile process?\r\n\r\nIn the longer version of the talk, we'll expand on the aforementioned tools by going through them in greater detail with several real-life examples, and also cover:\r\n\r\n* A case study of failures.\r\n    * What were the approaches that didn't work so well?\r\n    * Why did they fail and what can we learn from them?\r\n* Team suitability.\r\n    * Are there any _team_ characteristics that are necessary in order for an Influential Architect to be effective?\r\n    * What can we do to prepare teams for greater autonomy if they are not ready for it?\r\n* Architect suitability.\r\n    * Are there any _personal_ characteristics that significantly make this type of role easier to fulfil for the Influential Architect?\r\n* Evaluating outcomes.\r\n    * How do we measure our own success in influencing teams?\r\n    * How do we know which teams need more (or less) support than others?\r\n    * Under what circumstances might it be acceptable to stray from the technical vision?","notes":"This is probably best suited as a 30 minute talk, but can be expanded into a 90 minute talk if so desired. The presentation has no technical requirements other than a projector for the slides.\r\n\r\nMy presentations tend to be fun and engaging. I strive to offer ideas people can implement as soon as they get back from the conference, interwoven with self-deprecating humour. I gave a talk about Event Sourcing at last year's SATURN which was well received: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TeMYF_JjNg\r\n\r\nHaving lived and breathed the role of Influential Architect at Envato in Melbourne, Australia, I'm well-positioned to talk through the lessons I've learned throughout my journey. At Envato, we have 18 autonomous engineering teams working on several products in the digital marketplaces industry. Over 120 people are directly involved in the day-to-day development and delivery of software projects. As the only person with Software Architecture in my job title, I guide these teams and people to ensure that we are making sound technical descision and are all working towards the same technical vision.\r\n\r\nThe Influence approach we've been trialling at Envato has been very successful, with a transparent decision-making process and better outcomes. For the first time ever, we have a coherent long-term architectural vision that is understood and frequently referenced by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Teams are able to move faster, with the reassurance of knowing they are heading in the same direction as everyone else.\r\n\r\nI'm excited to share what I've learned about the role of a Software Architect at scale. The presentation is packed with advice on what's worked and what hasn't, and has concrete real-world examples rather than abstract ones. There should be interesting content for all types of architects even if they work in very different environments.","abstract":"In a company at scale with many fully autonomous and agile development teams, the architect's role is more about preventing entropy than it is setting direction.

The word “stream” implies a continuous process, but in real life that stream is far from homogeneous. Architects (or whoever else owns the design decisions) find themselves making decisions with widely varying impact, based on information with differing levels of uncertainty, throughout the life of a software solution. On top of that, the way these decisions and their impact are communicated evolves as the audience and the focus of the architectural communication change.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we explore the metaphor of a human lifetime to illustrate various aspects of architectural decision making, throughout a software solution’s life cycle. Amid all the fluidity of the stream of design decisions, we will look for anchor points with common concerns to address and recurring communication needs. We will see how the nature of architectural decisions changes when we go from birth (the first architectural outline) to graduation (making the business case), and find guidance on communicating the architecture at times of life-defining milestones like marriage (committing to the architecture) and revolutionary changes to the solution. The points will be illustrated by real-life examples from an interesting case study.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial is based on Risk- and Cost-Driven Architecture, a popular approach to improve architecture practices in both traditional and agile contexts, with the aim of providing “just enough anticipation” in the architecture. No prior knowledge of RCDA is required to attend.","notes":"This is a 90-minute tutorial.\r\n\r\nDuring the product lifecycle, key aspects of architectural decisions change, depending on the life stage:\r\n\r\n* level of risk and cost control: the cone of uncertainty\r\n* available information to base architectural decisions on\r\n* impact of architectural decisions\r\n* number of architectural decisions\r\n* cost of change to the architecture\r\n\r\nCertain milestones like graduation (approving the business case for the solution) and marriage (the moment after which it becomes very expensive to change the architecture) occur in every solution life cycle. Such milesones lead to standard stakeholder concerns, like affordability, level of risk control and predictability. We use the commonality of these concerns to provide the architect with standard views in their documentation, enabling them to show how the architecture addresses these common concerns.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n1.

This year, I am excited to share a case study of how it was applied at GE Renewables Digital to bring software products to renewables assets.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with IT, field engineers, data scientists, and software engineers I watched an entire digital organization grow agile and innovating.  My fellow architects were the guides who captured the tribal wisdom and rallied both executive and product management sponsorship to launch two product lines in 2017 – Digital Wind Farm and Digital Hydro Plant, both demoed at GE Minds and Machines 2016 event. \r\n\r\nThis session is based on my experience leading GE Digital Renewables architecture strategy for Asset Performance Management and Operations Optimization.  Renewables energy presents unique and diverse challenges when it comes to delivering software at scale.  Connecting hundreds and thousands of wind turbines and solar panels, fine-tuning analytics at the edge and the cloud, and assuring NERC compliance through Secure DevOps are some of the concerns to consider.\r\n\r\nThe participants will be walked through the journey and challenges on the way to migrating both existing applications and building brand new applications on a cloud platform and how architecture best practices accelerated the management and minimization of technical and functional debt.\r\n\r\nThe session also presents the trade-offs both at tactical and strategic level for moving forward with new technology without missing the beat of capturing the market opportunity for innovation leveraging horizontal products such as Asset Performance Management from Predix to accelerate renewables business objectives.\r\n\r\nTwo major product portfolios - The Digital Wind Farm and the Digital Hydro Plan were enabled with Common Renewables Asset Model based on IEC and S95 standards.   Model development was crowd-sourced to both IT, service engineering, and software development to capture both domain knowledge and leverage break-through features of distributed graph storage and scale with micro services.

However his hypothesis became known as Conway’s law and many organizations can say that they have observed the same behaviors as outlined in Melvin’s original paper. \r\n\r\nHere at IBM Watson, we just completed an initial release of a new microservice-based cloud platform. This service involved multiple teams, multiple microservices and multiple timezones.  We took a cloud product from inception on a lightening fast roller coaster ride to GA in five months, and lived to tell the story. We didn’t get everything right, but we learned alot along the way and we’d like to share those learnings. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will share our experience, and talk about some of the architectural successes and mistakes we made. We’ll talk about how we used Conway’s law, and the inverse Conway manuever to correct some of those mistakes. We’ll also touch on some of the issues confronting our teams with remote team members and how we solved them. We’ll provide a prescription for approaching team architecture based on our learnings. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the presentation, attendees will gained a knowledge of Conway’s law, how to use it to their advantage, and how to take an architecture led focus for team creation and development. \r\n\r\n","notes":"This will be a slide-based presentation with the following tentative outline:\r\n\r\n* Problem statement: Architecting teams is hard to get right the first time.

What do you mean by \"a cloud product\"? A software product that runs on the cloud? Is the cloud product the cloud platform that you mention in the previous sentence? In any case, can you say more about the nature of the software product?  \r\n\r\n2. If I understood correctly, this talk focuses on the architecture of the *team*, not the software architecture. It talks about team creation, team architecture. Conway's law is indeed about the organizational structure. That's fine! But you say the product is microservice-based. I think microservices are not only independent deployment and runtime elements, but they enable independent, smaller teams. Microservice teams are hence easier to put together and manage. Following this line of thought, we would need more guidelines and wisdom about how to create a team for monolithic applications.  :^)\r\n\r\n3.

In this talk Eric Normand will present an iterative process to define the essence of a domain and build composability into the core. The resulting abstractions lead to more robust code at the core of your application, and can give your business a competitive advantage. We will apply this process to the Processing graphics library to develop a composable vector graphics system.","notes":"This is a 60 minute talk.\r\n\r\nAfter attending the talk, the attendee will be able to:\r\n\r\n1. Know the difference between Newtonian-style abstractions and Aristotelian-style abstractions. Aristotelian abstractions are built up piecemeal and are full of corner cases, like Aristotelian physics. Newtonian abstractions are elegant, formal, and composable.\r\n\r\n2. Follow a design process for developing an algebraic abstraction that can compose and easily express solutions (Newtonian style). Building data transformation pipelines is the step most people who are learning functional programming get to from reading and experimenting. Building algebraic abstractions is the next step, but there isn't much literature on the topic (outside of academia)\r\n    1. Elaborate a physical metaphor\r\n    2. Describe the meaning of your metaphor as mathematical statements\r\n    3. Construct the meaning using constructs from the language\r\n    4. Implement the abstraction by refactoring the meaning\r\n\t\r\n\tThe physical metaphor is an important first step that gives us an anchor from which we may use our intuition. We then query our metaphor for its properties and write them in math, which usually means types and equations. After that, we can construct a runnable version of the meaning, being careful to build it out of parts constrained by our statements from step 2. Finally, the implementation becomes an easy matter of refactoring our runnable version.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis topic idea comes from my experience teaching functional programming to people with all levels of experience. There seems to be a logical progression of insights that people go through as they learn about functional programming. I don't see many people getting past the \"data transformation\" step, so I want to present something further. It's hard to say whether it's THE next step, but it is at least one step beyond transformations.\r\n\r\nA lot of the thinking comes from my experience as a professional Clojure and Haskell programmer and the work of Conal Elliott, John Hughes, and Gerald Sussman.\r\n\r\nI have given a version of this talk at Clojure/conj 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJIUoaIvD20 I would love to adapt this to a language like JavaScript.

The first paragraph is the short answer and the next two paragraphs are background and explanation.  Your interest is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThe model at CRA uses standards we developed for first data model for data collection which is bounded context.  In the ESRI data model we leveraged the Subtype and domains, where different subtypes drive the domains.  When we morphed the model into the ESRI standard electric utility model, the same holds true as the model is denormalized by mapping feature(i.e. transformer has a transformer layer rather than being one point feature in the point layer).\r\n\r\nThe modeling we applied has a time element.  There is a data collection stage of most any project which will require data to be normalized to geometry (points, lines and polygons representing features as electrical apparatus in the real world).  After this phase there is an information modeling aspect that requires use of standards to apply various third party tools and integrations.  The integrations vary depending on what solutions need to be integrated.  As budgets and priorities come into play the priorities are often different between power utilities.  However, Power utilities require Network Analysis and Power Outage Management Systems to maintain high systems availability.  The return on investment is staggering to implement the outage management and network analysis systems.  In addition the mapping must always tie to Work Management Systems.\r\n\r\nDepending on the Utility size, microservices are typically used, however, there may need to be some cost saving, less expensive integrations such as ETL to move data into another format (i.e. daily job).  This is what happened with CRA and happens with most Power Utilities (even most very large ones).  There is a second reason for the reason web services cannot always be used – much of it has to do with the industry needs a network model that has sufficient performance.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-09T13:43:04.671Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T13:43:04.671Z"},{"id":3157,"submission_id":7667,"talk_id":14587,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nThanks for your submission!

If you create an architecture that doesn’t give value to the customer you are wasting your time. When I talk to customers I often hear horror stories about how their current systems were developed by someone in an ivory tower who didn’t understand them or their work. So how do you make sure that you are bringing value to the customer through your architecture? Use customer centric design processes often called Contextual Design or Design Thinking. These are fundamental parts of Lean and Agile and this session shows how to use them in architecture with hands on experience. In this highly interactive session participants redesign a system by interviewing a customer, creating a prototype, reviewing it with the group, and getting feedback on their design.

I learned this method from the \"Deciding what to Design\" course at Carnegie Mellon. The method is often called Contextual Design or Design Thinking. Its a fundamental part of Lean and Agile. I've rarely seen people show how these methodologies apply to architecture, so thats my goal for class.\r\n\r\nI use this process in my own work at GE and previously at Verizon.  I lead the End to End Customer Experience efforts at Verizon and enabled our architects and software engineers to talk to customers. I gave a talk on that experience at a past SATURN that generated a lot of interest.\r\n\r\nAt GE I am using this method to design a new CI/CD system for our Industrial Internet of Things platform called Predix.

I used the \"App for adding contact to network\" use case and it ended up being a common but complex enough task that the groups had plenty to design. The Code on the Beach session was 60 minutes long and I assigned roles to each team member. I didn’t have time to have feedback given to each group, but I think it is an effective way to leverage the knowledge in the room. I didn’t have time to fit in the last wrap up session either, which I think is critical for people to concrete the new information.

I will ask each group to select someone in their group to be the \"customer.\" Each group will watch their customer collect a business card from a person and add a contact to their network of choice.\r\n\r\n25 minutes \r\nActivity 2: Design the system around the customer’s needs and document it in a prototype. The prototype should be as interactive as possible, not just a flow chart. Prototype should show the architecture elements. Because the “customer” is involved, the team should be constantly getting input from the customer on their on going design. They should also write down any assumptions they are making and any reasons they made design decisions. Finalize the prototype, the assumptions, design decisions, and what they learned from the process.\r\n\r\n30 minutes \r\nActivity 3: Review the prototype with the group. Receive feedback on design.

Variations for one-to-few, one-to-many, many-to-many. Tradeoffs. What to embed (_id / natural primary key / more than the natural primary key)?\r\n* However, if an object frequently needs to be accessed on its own, embedding may not be the best choice.\r\n* Don't embed very high cardinality documents on the \"many\" side. Variations and tradeoffs.\r\n* Don't denormalize a \"master\" field / document if it needs to be updated frequently. The cost of finding and updating all the instances may be too high.\r\n* If you frequently need to use data from documents from multiple collections when embedding is clumsy, don't be afraid of join at the application level.\r\n* Use the power of the Aggregation Framework for complex query requirements.\r\n* Get the best out of sharding. Choose shard keys for even distribution of writes and reads.\r\n\r\nFor Cassandra:\r\n\r\n* Again, model around the queries in your application.\r\n* Spread data evenly around the cluster.\r\n* Think of the database as a nested, sorted map data structure.\r\n* Denormalize for fast read performance. \r\n* Find the right balance between normalizing and denormalizing.\r\n* Using column names for values, and leaving the column value empty is OK.\r\n* Leverage wide rows for ordering, grouping and filtering.\r\n* Choose the row key appropriately to partition your records for good performance.\r\n* Segregate the read-heavy data from write-heavy data.\r\n\r\nAs suggested by you, I'll drop polyglot persistence, and model it as \"best practices for NoSQL schema design\". I think I should drop Neo4j, and limit myself to MongoDB and Cassandra for a more in-depth coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-31T17:28:11.274Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T17:28:11.274Z"}]},{"id":6588,"state":"waitlist","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2016-11-21T21:32:43.928Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T22:57:26.735Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8eBXGPl_5E&list=PLe9psSNJBf76DOOKMkDpyo_A5PfZk7JWc","rating":60.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["serverless","javascript","nodejs","awslambda","cloud"],"profile":{"name":"david@serverless.com","bio":"David Wells is a full stack developer at Serverless, Inc. in San Francisco.

We're going to discuss what serverless really means (hint: it's a way of abstracting OS-level infrastructure management from server-side application code), what the difference is between the various providers, why you would want to consider using a serverless architecture, and how you would go about implementing one.  We'll discuss greenfield development as well as a migration path for existing web applications.  Other interesting aspects covered will be how the development workflow will change and why, what testing will look like in a serverless world, and some pitfalls to avoid.  While a serverless approach can be applied to applications written in a variety of languages, Javascript will be the language used for this talk, so we will examine some of the popular serverless Javascript frameworks, including apex.js, claudia.js, and serverless.js.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in full-stack development, DevOps, micro-service architecture, containers, cutting operational costs, and/or just staying abreast with the latest application architecture approaches, this talk is for you.

We'll use DynamoDB as the no-SQL database.  We'll also be discussing (and may use) some of the serverless frameworks like serverless.js or claudia.js.\r\n\r\nI like that this is planned to be hands on and that you plan to discuss migration paths.

We'll walk through taking an existing web application and refactoring routes over to a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.  Depending on time, we may get into testing, deployment, and other advanced topics.\r\n\r\nIn what situations would you recommend someone not adopt server-less architectures?\r\n-  The biggest benefits for serverless are 1) decreased complexity for developers - abstracting away  server-level administration and devOps tasks and 2) lower costs for applications on VMs that spend time idling.  So, for those that have a mature, stable, and effective devOps infrastructure that already abstracts server complexity from developers and for those whose VMs don't have much idle computing time, transitioning to serverless probably isn't going to be cost/risk-effective.  \r\n\r\n- There may be other reasons to not transition: risk aversion (\"this is too new and unproven\"), compliance (\"we neither own the data center NOR manage any of the VM infrastructure??\"), or simple mistrust (\"how do I know it's going to scale when I really need it to?\") It's important that application architects take into consideration their corporate policies, compliance and risk requirements, and organizational change tolerance when considering serverless.","created_at":"2016-12-19T19:19:47.874Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T19:19:47.874Z"},{"id":2928,"submission_id":7119,"talk_id":13610,"user":{"name":"David Aktary","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/5152/2013_THR_David_Headshot.jpg","email":"aktaryda@gmail.com"},"body":"Apologies for the odd message formatting above...

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. The term serverless is actually quite broad and poorly defined. For example, [Mike Roberts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) associates serverless to the use of MBaaS (more common), or alternatively richer clients (SPA?) talking to services behind an API gateway. Your talk probably has a clear description of what a serverless architecture is to you, but I'm thinking a brief definition in the talk description itself would also be helpful to correctly set the expectations of participants looking at the conference program.\r\n\r\n2. Assuming this is a 90-minute participatory session, the talk description (visible to conference participants) at some point has to clearly state this is a hands-on session and attendees should have a github and AWS account, and bring their laptops.\r\n\r\n3.

Short meeting with business stakeholders is conducted in order to review formed list of attributes and metrics and checking priorities. 5. Work is done and list of attributes and related metrics is formed.\r\n\r\nSuch approach works extremely good when: 1. There are available technologists on customer side. 2.

For mission to Mars I'd stick to SEI version of QAW. That's why on one hand if we will miss something - this most likely will not be a big issue (even though we do our best to not miss anything). On another hand we are trying to predict list of key quality attributes and verify it vs customer stakeholders after that (starting with technology people if they are available). \r\n\r\nSo, insuring mechanism looks like: \r\n1. Form list of key attributes and metrics for them using your experience (the more mature and experienced your are - the better)\r\n2. Discuss it with customer engineers (Architects, CTOs, etc) and improve/update it with their opinion\r\n3. Discuss it with customer business people to make sure that business agrees with point of view of engineers.\r\n4. Form your library of typical sets of key quality attributes and metrics for different cases - this will speed up your work in the future and secure your from missing something.\r\n\r\nHave I replied your question? \r\n\r\nP.S.: I'll be glad to see you in Minsk! :) Let's contact each other in LinkedIn.","created_at":"2017-01-25T12:12:33.651Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T12:12:33.651Z"}]},{"id":7587,"state":"waitlist","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2017-01-05T07:44:34.323Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T23:33:01.441Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":50.4,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["90 minute","quality goals","quality models","quality tailoring workshop"],"profile":{"name":"David Gelperin","bio":"David Gelperin is CTO of ClearSpecs Enterprises.

Unfortunately, many customers, managers, and developers have little understanding of how to specify, achieve, or verify quality goals.  Barry Boehm ranks qualities among his top 10 sources of serious project risk.\r\n\r\nThe SEI recommends that quality goals be identified in Quality Attribute Workshops (QAWs).  QAWs identify quality goals indirectly with scenarios and rely on “quality experts” to map scenarios onto quality goals.  Unfortunately, this indirect approach does not help customers make tradeoff decisions because of their poor understanding of quality relationships.  While scenarios are useful in describing some quality attributes, such as aspects of performance, they are not as useful for others, such as safety.\r\n\r\nWe propose an alternative approach based on the tailoring of a comprehensive quality attribute model to the needs of a project.  The model contains over 60 quality attributes.  Each attribute has over 30 characteristics including indicators and measures, supporting and conflicting qualities, threats and mitigations, and achievement and verification tactics.  The model also contains guidance on defining, achieving, and verifying quality goals.  The model is freely available at quality-aware.com.\r\n\r\nThis model distinguishes external qualities (visible to users e.g. reliability) from internal qualities (only visible to developers e.g. code readability).  We propose that goals for relevant external qualities be identified and defined in a tailoring workshop that includes most stakeholders.  Internal quality goals should be identified and defined in a meeting of technical management and senior developers.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will review the attributes model and simulate a tailoring workshop.","notes":"","abstract":"Identification of quality goals is hindered by poor understanding of quality attributes.

Please find some of my responses.\r\n\r\n1.\tIn the Talk Description, why is transformation capitalized in SOA Transformation? In particular, this phrase is not clear and somewhat intriguing: \"the Software Transformation journey we should have in a fast-moving environment, where the agility is the key\". Maybe there's more objective motivation for the specific transformations you will describe.\r\n\r\nMost of the organizations which grow very fast tend to first focus on getting things done quickly and later worry about getting things done in the perfect fashion. This kind of accustoms business stakeholders used to seeing quick results. It takes some time to realize the importance of SOA, standardization, governance. When an organization attempts to do a Transformation Journey replacing the majority of the monolithic code base with industry standard COTS/SAAS/Systems/Custom Built Systems, coupled with the transition to SOA there is still a level of impatience to see quick results. Also, there is an expectation that buying SAAS/COTS products means they would start working immediately. These misconceptions posed significant challenges for us to keep providing continuous Business Value as well as working towards accomplishing embracing SOA. So, on one hand, we were doing a major re-haul of our systems and on another hand also making sure that we embrace SOA as well as providing incremental business value. We accomplished SOA not in isolation but by coupling tangible business benefits spread over a period of time also delivering incrementally. Those are the details I would like to share and that’s the reason why I would like to call it an SOA Transformation. \r\n\r\n2.\tI think most of the material out there is settling to using microservices as opposed to micro-services.\r\nI’ll have this corrected. Thank you!\r\n\r\n3.\tIf you find that your talk is too long, I suggest removing the first topic (\"Rackspace - Business and System Perspective\").\r\nPlease see point 4.\r\n\r\n4.\tI think the description is somewhat vague, especially for a 90-minute session. If it's 90 minutes long, it takes the time equivalent to 3 30-minute talks, so the info should be clearly valuable. You mention a case study. Maybe you should say more about the case study.\r\n\r\nThe introduction around Rackspace - Business and System Perspective is supposed to say more about the case study. Based on the time that is allotted, I would get this condensed accordingly. I would ideally prefer 60 minutes. 90 minutes seems to be a stretch.\r\n\r\n5.\tThings you could add to the description to make it more interesting: what technology transformation will you talk about? If it's monolithic to microservices, what do your monoliths looked like? Java EAR apps? MS .NET? Where do you run your microservices? Docker? Kubernetes? What tools and frameworks did you add to your runtime environment, development environment, continuous integration/deployment environment?\r\n\r\nSure I would add more details. The presentation is more around how we introduced SOA, embraced a culture of SOA and the difficulties we faced in the transformation. We had a couple of huge monoliths built mainly using Python/Java and they had undergone many revisions. The processes that we had were initially divergent and people dependent. From there we moved towards SOA, standardization of technology, deployment processes, CI and partly CD, and we could add details around the exact technology selection and standardization process we have also including details about Docker and other technologies we use. The challenges that would be described would be more on the lines of the phased steps we took to provide incremental business value and to reduce risks which helped as accomplish a major transformation. This an ongoing journey and we would talk about how we are beginning to embrace Microservices.\r\n\r\n6.\tI think the most challenging aspect of the monolith-to-microservice transition is finding the appropriate functional scope for the microservices. If they are too small, you may end up with chatty communications and lower autonomy and performance. If a microservice encompasses functional contexts that is too large, you move closer to the monolithic model and may not significantly realize the microservices benefits. What approaches have you used to help define the size of microservices? Did DDD help?\r\n\r\nGreat point, As an enterprise organization, we have not gone into a spree of replacing everything into MicroService. We are finding right use cases where we really could provide value out of carving Micro Services or introducing new MicroServices. I plan to present a case study of one such real use case and the practical benefits we gained from it. We have applied DDD concepts like Bounded Context and also to further split into Sub Contexts to select MicroService Candidates which helps in defining an appropriate logical boundary. We have also beginning to introduce Micro FrontEnds. Also during our SOA Transformation, we had already begun to apply many of the MicroService Principles even though the term hasn’t become popular. We would also provide those details.\r\n\r\n7.\tWhat communication mechanisms did you use in microservices (what connector types)? Http (REST)? WebSocket? Asynchronous messages/events?\r\n\r\nWe have standardized on HTTP/REST. We had also build our own Messaging Infra Structure using REST: Atom Hopper. ATOM was used as the Messaging Standard across the Services. However within the Bounded Context Teams were free to pick appropriate messaging platforms.\r\n\r\n8.\tI think \"methods of how to accomplish large-scale technology transformations\" is quite ambitious. If you don't have exactly methods, but guidelines or best practices derived from experience, that's ok too.\r\nSure I would rephrase as per your suggestion.

Its helps the attendees to build their web applications more securely using Web Security Tools. With the help of websecurity tools, People can attack their own designed Web applications and check for the vulnerabilities in their applications and code it more securely.  \r\n\r\nFor an instance, Assume a coder created Login page, He can use ZAP (Mozilla Security Automation Project) to attack his Login page and sort out the ways to trace out the flaws. In this way ZAP gives the coder chance to build their Web Application more securely. (Though its only one of the many features of ZAP).\r\n\r\n### Session Plan: [Tech talks and tech tutorials track 90min]\r\n\r\n-> Importance of Web Secuirty - 5min \r\n\r\n-> Discussing OWASP Top 10 vulneribities [Each vulnerabity will take 3min for discussion] - 30min \r\n\r\n-> Discussing on available open source security tools such as Vega Scanner, Open VAS, Nikto and Uniscan. [4 tools X 5min] - 20min \r\n\r\n-> Introducing ZAP as a testing environment - 10min\r\n\r\n-> Live Demo [Scanning vulnerable web application to detect vulnerabilities and various other features of the ZAP] - 20min \r\n\r\n-> QA - 5min\r\n\r\n### Outcome:\r\n\r\nThis session would be able to show path for the attendees how he/she can contribute to Mozilla in Security Aspects. The participant can be able to learn following areas: \r\n\r\n→ Participant will grasp detailed knowledge on how a web application functions on browser and how he/she detect vulnerabilities. (By learning from OWASP Top ten vulnerabilities ) \r\n\r\n→ Solving vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n→ Contributing to open source security tools.\r\n\r\n→ Working on bugs related to vulnerabilities issues.\r\n\r\n→ Start contributing to ZAP or other open source security projects in both tech/non-tech aspects.\r\n","notes":"This talk is proposed for 90min under Tech talks and Tech tutorial track.\r\n\r\nThis talk focuses on bringing awareness on importance of web security for Web Developers. The talks deals with the major threats posed for web applications and the ways to overcome them. I am going to introduce an open source web application tool which ranked first as Top Web Security tool be \"toolswatch.org\". It is ZAP(Zed Attack Proxy). I am ZAP Evangelist for India. The session would also focus on other available open source web security tools to make session technology agonistic. I had worked on a project for ZAP under Mozilla Winter of Security 2014 with Mozilla Cloud Security team. I have experience of taking sessions related to web security. The recent talk was given at “Rivera Dev 2016” happened at Sophia-Tech campus in Sophia Antipolis, French Riviera, France. I am part of Mozilla Tech Speakers team. I am comfortable to speak about different security aspects. I have experience of working with former Security Developer from US NSA(National Security Agency) as Summer Intern at OWASP.

The tutorial will cover why web security testing is important, what vulnerabilities are most common and how the ZAP tool can help developers check their software for these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe good and to improve:\r\nPrevious experience and presentations are listed, which increases the confidence that the presenter can deliver the material well. I like the fact that a live demo will be included. A video of a previous speaking engagement would be appreciated. I think this may be needed to get the confidence that the English accent of the speaker is easily understood.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the talk is on testing and the author’s experience includes mostly developer conferences. It is unclear how the talk’s take-aways are relevant for architects, clarification on this point would be helpful. For example, does ZAP help applying design patterns? That said, many developers attend SATURN and many architects code.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes listed are ambitious for a 15-min talk. It runs the risk of becoming a sales pitch for ZAP and an invitation to contribute to the project. Which leads to the following idea.\r\n\r\nIdea:\r\nI think the Technical Talks and Tutorials track may be more suitable. This gives space for a 30-min deep dive and demo as proposed, leaving room for interaction with the audience.

The proposed session was for 1hr. I may have selected 15minutes talk format by mistake.\r\n\r\nTo keep the talk technology agnostic, I am not only focusing on ZAP security tool but also on other open source web security tools such as Vega Scanner, Open VAS, Nikto and Uniscan. \r\n\r\nDue to time constraint, I will be showing live demo only on ZAP. Its not gonna be like sales pitch at all. I am just using a tool to help me find the vulnerabilities in web application so that developer can know and build application more securely.\r\n\r\nIf my talk is accepted under Technical Talks and Tutorial track (assuming each talk will be given 1hr duration), my talk will be following below structure:\r\n\r\n-> Importance of Web Secuirty - 5min\r\n-> Discussing OWASP Top 10 vulneribities [Each vulnerabity will take 2min for discussion] - 20min \r\n-> Talking about 4 available open source tools [4 tools X 5min] - 20min\r\n-> Live Demo [Scanning vulnerable web application to detect vulnerabilities and various other features of the tool] - 10min\r\n-> QA - 5min\r\n\r\nAbout ZAP: \r\nThe OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world’s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by hundreds of international volunteers. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. Its also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing.\r\n\r\nIt is a great tool for web developers but not much use for software architects.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further queries, feel free to ping me at damarla.sumanth@gmail.com\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T10:48:05.587Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T10:48:05.587Z"},{"id":3561,"submission_id":7648,"talk_id":14553,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Sumanth, you should still be able to go in and update your submission, please go ahead and do so.

Modules are design-time units with fixed domains and hidden design decisions. Modules particularly promote systematic correctness analyses. However, these beneficial properties disappear once the modules have been integrated into and deployed on target machines. For embedded systems that run within tight real-time constraints, modules may even hamper integration tests and fault analyses, due to the inaccessibility of modules' internals. Hence, for an HW/SW-integration platform of an X-by-wire eCar, we developed HDCs in order to non-intrusively trace and test the behavior of single and multiple modules (HDCs) integrated into one or more platform nodes.\r\n\r\nHDCs transfer modules from design-time entities to runtime entities. HDCs can be tested in integrated systems during field operation, without code instrumentation and probing effects. For this purpose, the HDC runtime environment captures data structures that flow within and between HDCs for one macro cycle (e.g. lasting 10 ms) of the time-triggered system; each macro cycle anew. An HDC can access only internal and parametric data structures. The probe is the only HDC with full access to all data structures, including its own. Because they are half-open for the probe and half-closed for all other HDCs, we call these data capsules hemispheric.\r\n\r\nIn the presentation, we will first reveal requirements behind HDCs originating from an industry study on an HW/SW-integration platform providing safety services to a fail-operational eCar (www.projekt-race.de/en). We will then sketch tests that can be run for HDCs. This motivates the design of an HDC system and its effect on the application and implementation of HDCs in general and the probe in particular, which we will describe afterwards. We will critically reflect on our experiences with HDCs during development, in the lab and in the field, as well as on the applicability of HDCs to event-triggered, object-oriented systems as basis for discussion.","notes":"","abstract":"A Hemispheric Data Capsule (HDC) is a runtime entity of a module with externalized data structures.

It is a time-triggered system that must perform critical functions within milliseconds. When we talk about the system context of HDC and requirements behind HDC we will also explain our definition of real-time. We announced already to talk about \"requirements behind HDCs originating from …\". Please see the agenda in last paragraph of the lecture description.\r\n\r\n(2) Ad \"implementation disadvantages and costs\", \"guide developers to HDCs\" and \"what worked or didn't work\".\r\n\r\nConsiderations of issues and drawbacks are necessary for a balanced picture on HDC. Following your comments we will explicitly address chronometric hits because timing considerations are important for a real-time system that works with tight operation schedules.\r\n\r\nA proper place for talking about challenges in general with HDC could be the section \"critical reflection on HDC\" which is already on the agenda. Currently, we do not intend to go into details regarding the development process. The presentation aims at technical matters of HDC. However, since modularization in general and working with HDC in particular affect the development organization and process, we are going to take a position on these points during the presentation as well.\r\n\r\nKind regards.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-02T15:32:42.019Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T15:32:42.019Z"}]}},{"id":7173,"submission":{"id":7173,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2016-12-15T21:30:07.676Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T18:27:19.790Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-RBaNTGJSk&list=PLvk9Yh_MWYuwTYjxOqjzOlVmFFHvN3Yp7&index=1&t=3s","rating":87.5,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["devops","metrics","kpi","30-min tech talk"],"profile":{"name":"Avantika Mathur","bio":"Avan (Avantika) Mathur is the Product Manager for ElectricFlow.

As the biggest ecommerce company of the Netherlands and Belgium security risks grew exponentially. But it’s not scalable to let your security team grow with the same rate. That’s why we also focused on creating a security culture within the company: making security a responsibility of everyone, not only the security team.\r\n\r\nTo not only create this culture in IT but also in the rest of the company, we organized Abuser Story workshops for Product Owners and Business Analysts. Abuser stories are a fun way of thinking about the security of your new features. It triggers to think of unhappy flows, think of thresholds to monitor and so on. Making the systems Secure by Design, something really relevant for architects. We saw that Product Owners consulted the security team and architects way more for advice when designing new systems, they gave room and time to developers to write secure code, and discussions between the Security and development teams were actually constructive. It helped to get the “security, we are in this together” mindset. \r\n\r\nIn this talk Jim will tell the journey of bol.com, the growing importance of security, and the way we tried to cope with it in a fun way. The lessons learned are valuable for every (growing) company that struggles with making security scalable, and assuring that you will not only be secure today or tomorrow but also in 5-10 years.\r\n","notes":"Creating awareness in (IT) companies regarding security is becoming really important, and we saw that this awareness should extend way beyond IT.

I will try to answer your questions below and give some additional information.\r\n\r\nAbout what I will tell about how we embedded a security culture in the company:\r\nSo how do you already get that security mindset embedded in earlier stages. How do you get people excited to think about security? Security has the prejudice that it is boring, that is something you have to do, maybe because someone else says so. Like the security team/department. But security can also be fun! Fun? Yes! By stimulating the employees to think like a hacker, either technical or functional, they got motivated to think of security requirements by approaching it from the other side. This in combination with the right tools really helped to get our security level to high standards.\r\n\r\nSome more information about the Abuser Story Workshop:\r\nWith abuser stories we touch on a subject everybody worked with: user stories. Normally with user stories you define new functionality that you develop with the customer in mind. But how can this functionality be abused? We stimulate the colleagues creativity to think evil and create a hacker mindset for themselves. Turn it around: write an Abuser story: As a hacker, I want…, So that… We were surprised by the evilness of our colleagues – we had some real hackers among us. We do this by introducing a simple proces, let one team think about abuser stories (so how could you as a hacker abuse this functionality), and the other team about user stories on how to avoid abuse. After that the 'Attacking' team presents its abuser stories, which the other team needs to 'Defend' with one of their user stories. We then stimulate the Product Owners to braintorm about abuser stories at the kickoff of each new functionality, more or less facilitate their own workshop. The outcome is then translated in requirements for the different user stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are actually two ways of how you can approach this talk. \r\n\r\n1. A (comprehensive) talk about the journey of bol.com and how we embedded a security culture, where I will deep dive more in how we did this with the use of Abuser Story Workshops. This focusses more on how we created this security culture, and the lessons we learned from this proces.\r\n\r\n2. A short talk about the journey of bol.com and how we embedded a security culture, and facilitating a Abuser Story Workshop to illustrate how we did this. This focusses more on teaching you how you could facilitate these workshops yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\nRelevance for audience: the first is relevant for a broader audience, where the second talk (workshop form) is more relevant for Analysts and Product Owners.\r\n\r\nI hope this gives you more insights. If you have any questions or you want me to elaborate a bit more, just let me know.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJim","created_at":"2017-01-05T10:15:16.558Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T10:15:16.558Z"},{"id":3126,"submission_id":7384,"talk_id":14092,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks, Jim.

But one of the nagging questions teams face is: how to establish the architecture for a system the agile way? After all, architectural decisions have a key impact on various qualities of a system, and therefore, these decisions have to be taken early and carefully. How does this fit with the incremental and iterative nature of agile methodologies? \r\n\r\nIn this session, I'll cover the following aspects: \r\n\r\n* Creating an architecture vision, including desired architectural qualities, during Sprint Zero \r\n* Identifying potential strategies for achieving the desired architectural qualities, without creating an ivory tower architecture\r\n* Prioritizing the architectural qualities and adding them to the Product Backlog along with the functional requirements \r\n* Implementing and verifying architectural qualities with the help of real stories from the Product Backlog.   \r\n\r\nI will take concrete examples from projects on how to apply the above concepts.","notes":"I have been in the IT industry for 32 years.

We want them to evolve with the needs of the business, its customers and stakeholders, and to be resilient in the face of ever changing market conditions and the external environment. This level of adaptability and responsiveness needs to be supported by the architecture of the systems we create. The complexity of the environment that architects find themselves in is increasing in recent years, with cloud, DevOps, continuous deployment, micro services and other elements adding to the factors that architects must consider. With this growing complexity, architects need to be supported by effective decision-making approaches.\r\n\r\nSize is also a factor. Larger systems and larger organizations have, by definition, a larger number of dependencies (internal and external) that must be managed, and a larger number of stakeholders (internal and external) whose needs must be addressed. The architecture of larger systems can involve hundreds or thousands of people, creating dozens to hundreds of products, components and subsystems that all need to work together. Maintaining the conceptual integrity of the architecture under such circumstances, and over time, presents many challenges and a greater need for coherence. \r\n\r\nTo navigate all of this, agile architects need to be adaptive; they need the ability to dynamically shift their decision-making approach to match the complexity of the circumstances they face. This session will describe how lessons from complexity science, and in particular, sense making and the Cynefin framework, can help architects to be more agile in how they work, and in turn, help them develop architectures that are more agile and adaptive to the needs of the organizations they serve.\r\n\r\n### Learning Outcomes\r\n* Applying sense making in the context of architecture\r\n* Applying the Cynefin framework to architecture problems and decisions\r\n* Examples of architecture problems and decisions that can be mapped to the different domains represented by the Cynefin framework (obvious, complicated, complex, chaotic and disorder)\r\n* How to manage the transition of architecture problems between these different domains\r\n* Implications for organization structure and communications\r\n* How such an approach leads to a more resilient architecture, and a more antifragile organization\r\n* How complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework supports emergent architecture\r\n* How complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework help the organization and the architecture to be more agile\r\n\r\n### Format\r\nFor a 90-minute workshop I typically use the following format. \r\n\r\nPart 1 (5 minutes):\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n* Overview of concepts\r\n\r\nPart 2 (10 minutes): \r\n\r\n* Architecture descriptions\r\n* Using narrative to understand architecture\r\n\r\nPart 3 (40 minutes):\r\n\r\n* Sense Making analysis of architectures and their influence on the organisation\r\n* Analysing the patterns that emerge from the sense making activity\r\n\r\nPart 4 (30 minutes):\r\n\r\n* The Cynefin Framework, and how it applies to architecture\r\n* Designing experiments\r\n\r\nPart 5 (5 minutes):\r\n\r\n* Debrief and wrap up\r\n\r\n","notes":"The majority of the session is highly participatory. All five parts outlined in the session description have some element of participation. Parts 2-4 are the major parts of the session. In part 2, I guide participants through sketching their architecture and creating narrative about their architecture. In part 3, I guide participants in analysing their architecture/sketch/narrative using a sense making framework. In part 4, I guide participants in understanding the Cynefin framework in more detail and designing an experiment to address complex challenges that emerge in the analysis. Parts 1 and 5 have less activity, but still have dialog and interaction.\r\n\r\nI will bring all the supplies that I need to run the exercise. It is more effective if the room is set up “banquet style”, with round tables that set groups of 6-10. \r\n\r\nI have been working with sensemaking and complexity for a few years now, and have run variations of this activity many times, both inside Cisco and at conferences and other forums. At the heart of this is the concept of applying sensemaking and the Cynefin framework to managing the complexity faced by architects. That complexity is not just in the architecture itself, but also in the problem domain, the organization, and the wider context within which architects do their work.\r\n\r\nMy background is in software engineering and architecture, in the context of product and systems development, and in transforming engineering organizations around the world. I use the techniques I present here in my own work, and I also help architects, engineers, and others, apply these techniques in their work.\r\n","abstract":"To create resilient and antifragile systems, architects must use decision-making approaches that help them better navigate the complexity of their environment.

We can then relegate all interpretations of those events to subsystems that are easy to build, change, and replace when necessary. The resulting systems have single responsibilities and are decoupled from each other, which makes them simple to modify. Event Sourcing can enable us to move faster by supporting rapid experimentation with new perspectives, new user interactions, and new insights into our business.\r\n\r\nEvent Sourcing is agnostic of technology stack and language style, but it goes well with another pattern called CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation. In this talk, we will do a deep-dive into the two patterns and scope out a system that has:\r\n\r\n* Receiving and validating Commands that, if successful, result in Events (with pseudocode to illustrate how it might work).\r\n* Interpreting Events into denormalised projections for very fast reads.\r\n* Single responsibility services for reacting to Events by creating other events and, if necessary, triggering external behaviour.\r\n\r\nWe will also cover more in-depth topics, such as:\r\n\r\n* Strategies for evolving events and event schemas over time.\r\n* Dealing with eventual consistency.\r\n* Popular technologies for various system components, such as how to store and distribute events.","notes":"This is a 90 minute talk.

In my experience this happens for a few reasons:  architecture documentation is rejected as being too heavyweight, documentation is typically out of sight and out of mind, and many developers don't know what to document.  Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), a lightweight documentation approach [proposed by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), solves these problems by recording design decisions in a simple markdown template in the same repository as the code affected by the ADR.  In this talk we will share our experiences and lessons using ADRs over the past year while working on multiple projects for IBM Watson.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk you will be able to create effective ADRs, introduce them to your team, and avoid common pitfalls with the method.","notes":"This talk is intended to be a 30 minute experience report.  I can't figure out how to change the session type to match this.\r\n\r\nThe talk will have the following tentative outline.\r\n\r\n1. Introduction / Problem overview: teammates don't have architectural context, decisions aren't communicated and are lost over time\r\n   * Failed attempts to solve the problem -- wikis, dedicated repos, \"official\" documentation\r\n2. ADRs Overview\r\n   * Nygard's proposal\r\n   * Connection to other work and research\r\n3. How we use ADRs\r\n4. Exercise: Create an ADR (optional, may fall out depending on timing, at most this is a 5-7 minute exercise)\r\n5. Case Study: IBM Watson Information Retrieval Enhanced team\r\n   * This section will include the proposed lessons and tips for adopting and using ADRs based on our experiences\r\n   * Create a common template that everyone agrees to use\r\n       * examples from case study\r\n   * Identify an architecture champion to point out when architectural design decisions happen\r\n   * Add ADR creation tasks to the backlog\r\n   * Use pull requests and peer reviews to teach people how to record a decision and to\r\n       spread konwledge about decisions\r\n   * Use ADRs to grow architects on your team\r\n       * Creating an ADR is a small slice of design responsibility.  It turns out to be a great way to\r\n           infuse the team with architectural thinking and train new architects\r\n   * Store ADRs with the code\r\n   * Works great with microservices where small groups of people and the code\r\n       they create work autonomously within a light governance framework\r\n   * Revisit old ADRs every so often to update them and ensure you have accurate reflection of current thinking\r\n6. Problems we ran into with ADRs and are still working through\r\n   * Plain text diagramming is a pain point.\r\n   * ADRs emphasize architectural decisions for a single component.  This is great for smaller projects and\r\n      individual microservices but falls apart when multiple architectural components stored in multiple code\r\n      repositories are involved.\r\n      * Our solution was to create an \"Architecture\" repository, which stored ADRs that cut across multiple\r\n         architectural components, linking to refinement ADRs as appropriate.\r\n   * Overemphasis on design decisions at the expense of other design documentation\r\n       * The team became awesome at recording ADRs to the point where they wouldn't document anything else!\r\n       * ADRs were smashing success.  Complementary methods that are as simple and lightweight are needed for\r\n          design concepts other than decisions.  examples: alternatives, governance policies, general design guidance,\r\n          quality attribute scenarios and other architecturally significant requirements\r\n7. Conclusion\r\n   * closing thoughts on using ADRs as a way to \"sneak in\" architecture\r\n   * great way to create a history of the project and explain not only where we are but how the system arrived at this point\r\n   * Show where ADRs fit as part of an documentation strategy \r\n   * Links to additional resources","abstract":"Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture key architectural design decisions in a lightweight, easy-to-create, plain text template stored in your existing version control system.

I am familiar with the Tyree/Ackermann paper.  I actually [referenced the same paper as a comment on the blog](http://disq.us/p/18d4i4r) about 8 months ago in an attempt to point out the same thing!  We also include a link to Nygard's blog and that paper in our ADR template as background information.\r\n\r\nI am certainly planning to make this connection in the talk, if accepted.  The two templates have the same goal in the end but collect slightly different information.  The ADR is significantly simpler, if nothing else.  I think a key difference and the thing that is kind of unique about Nygard's approach is in what is done with this information.  It sounds simple, but storing the design decisions in the version control system acted almost as a stealth way of injecting some of the ideas from Views and Beyond into the team.  What's more a small ecosystem of tools has sprung up around ADRs.  See https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools and https://github.com/holytshirt/dotnet-adr as examples.\r\n\r\nFinally, Thougtworks recently [classified ADRs as \"trial\" methodology](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records).

I first encountered the importance of maintaining Architectural Decisions ass a part of the SEI Views and Beyond book. I have been a great advocate and have used them ever since. I think its an important technique that needs good attention and would help many Architects attending the conference. The approach of understanding software architecture in terms of a variety of architecture decisions is now widely recognized.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do have a suggestion. Instead of the talk just focusing on ADR as suggested by Michael Nygard, what would be even useful is discussing the approaching of Documenting Architecture Decisions as a whole, which decisions to document and not, the payback/benefits and the variants available for documenting them along with your case study.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am concerned about the idea of just storing the Architecture Decisions in isolation without many other significant Architectural Artifacts. I understand that the Thoughtworks seems to recommend including them in the “trial” methodology. However, I am just concerned with the misnomer that these are the only set of significant artifacts for all cases. Could the details be presented more on the lines of Evolutionary Architecture.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-04T06:17:59.216Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T06:17:59.216Z"},{"id":3066,"submission_id":7391,"talk_id":14103,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Yogeshwar, thanks for your feedback!\r\n\r\nI share your concerns and plan to address them in the talk.  I mentioned the points you raise under section 6.  I am certainly not suggesting this is the only set of artifacts required and recognize this is a trap teams easily fall into -- one of my teams did!\r\n\r\nWith respect to deciding when to document a decision vs. not, I plan to cover that under 5.4 and 5.5.  It turns out that people don't always know or recognize when an architectural decision has been made.  Pull requests and explicit architecture tasks combined with pairing was how we worked through some of those issues, in addition to including clear guidance in our template.  Basically we created situations for on the job training over time.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to attempt to place this technique within the context of the broader literature, as you suggest.  As you also point out, the idea of recording decisions is not new and is a commonly understood good practice.  The point of this talk is not to retread old ground but to look at good practice from the perspective of a newer method that people actually use and seems to resonate well with developers.  These ideas have been around for a while, and yet few teams practice them.  Why?  I think this method is another incremental step in the right direction.  By the end of the talk people will be armed with the knowledge they need to be successful with the method, not just try it out.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMichael","created_at":"2017-01-04T14:17:27.098Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T14:17:27.098Z"},{"id":3075,"submission_id":7391,"talk_id":14103,"user":{"name":"Yogeshwar Srikrishnan","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33bed537dc2a17123b3491737913e0a9?s=500","email":"yoga80@yahoo.com"},"body":"Thanks for the detail!

We have updated the description and notes section per your requests. \r\n\r\nRe: “Deploy any application to any environment using any tool-set”:\r\n\r\nActually, a LOT of ElectricFlow users use the platform for deploying of Embedded devices (Huawei, Qualcomm, General Motors, MIP, automotive manufacturers, etc.)- so it’s not just for web applications. While the DEMO part of the talk shows a Java web application deployed using Docker, the platform itself does support any deployment target- be it mainframe, embedded devices, hardware, mobile, etc., and can plug-in any point tool (including unique tools used by Chip/automotive manufacturers, etc.) and technology stack.\r\n\r\nGed - do these updates answer any of your questions as well?\r\n\r\nLet me know if this helps. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nAvan\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-03T23:43:10.482Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T23:43:10.482Z"},{"id":3036,"submission_id":7179,"talk_id":13725,"user":{"name":"Ged Byrne","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef4de37718ebb5c4fc1c2236331ee9d9?s=500","email":"ged.byrne@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Avan,\r\n\r\nThank-you for your response.  The updates do help to answer my questions, but it does leave me with a couple of concerns.\r\n\r\nThe first is still regarding the the claim: \"Deploy any application to any environment using any tool-set – for free.\" \r\n\r\nWhen you say \"free\" do you mean free of licensing cost, or free of the cost of \"the operational and technology overhead.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim that it is free of licencing cost is valid, with a few caveats.  The tools being integrated are free of charge and Electric Cloud can be free for up to 10 community hosts.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not so sure about the claim regarding overhead costs.  As you say earlier in the submission: \"the operational and technology overhead of orchestrating the hand-offs from one tool to the next in the process are not without cost.\"  The later claim that you\r\n\r\nDoes electric cloud eliminate costs for ANY tool, or only the tools for which a plug-in already exists?   What about tools that do not have an existing plug-in?  \r\n\r\nMy second concern is that the presentation feels like product demonstration.  It appears to introduce the problem of overhead costs for automation and orchestration and then present Electric Cloud as the solution to that problem.\r\n\r\nThe audience of Architects would like to go deeper than that.  They would be interested in seeing how Electric Cloud is solving this problem.

This covers areas such as integration (how do I get data into / out of the blockchain), analytics (how do I gain insight into the data held by the blockchain?), and APIs (providing managed access to a blockchain within an enterprise).\r\n- Recommendations on how to get started\r\n\r\nI also weave a couple of demonstrations into the flow, just to show what a blockchain \"looks like\" (e.g. what does a smart contract look like, how does an integration technology tie into a blockchain).  The session is geared towards \"beginners\", so this particular talk does not get into the \"low-level\" details of the code.\r\n\r\nThis talk can also fit into a 30 minute session if that would work better for the agenda.

Regarding the hands-on techniques for visualizations - I use a blend of storymapping with domain modeling to focus on 'what architecture when'.  I also use a simple quadrant that weighs architectural impacts on cost of being wrong and ease of change to talk considerations that might move more decisions to be lower cost / easier to swap (though not always the case).\r\n\r\nWhere this gets into micro services and cloud computing is using these - namely storymapping - to drive domains for services and inject some chaos thinking into cloud computing - if this service were to go down, what is the impact on the product and what should it be?  What is the cost.  \r\n\r\nI delivered a similar talk a few months back at Surge Conference in DC though it was an hour - the video was posted, but they have revved their site for the 2017 conference and I cannot find it a direct link to it.

I agree this is an important topic for organizations that want to move to continuous deployment, especially when their systems use shared databases. Database changes are not handled directly by Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. You need something else tool-wise. \r\nIn our organization we are using Flyway. One of the challenges we are facing is that the DBAs lose operational control over table schemas. That's less of a problem if each system (or microservice) has its own dedicated database. But in many enterprise IT environments, there's still some centralization of database changes. Continuous delivery/deployment with Flyway (or similar) will typically ask developers to author DDL statements that will eventually be automatically executed in production upon system initialization. I hope your presentation will touch on this aspect.","created_at":"2017-02-07T12:19:33.147Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T12:19:33.147Z"}]}},{"id":7834,"submission":{"id":7834,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-10T14:52:26.339Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:07:54.622Z","additional_info":"Links for Presentations\r\n\r\nAWS Reinvent 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbLhfiXVP6Q&index=2&list=PLz79c1Qow_bW8DdjJKRtIRngqKEArQ4Rm\r\n\r\nServerless Conf London Oct 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-w6a9rcy8&index=1&list=PLz79c1Qow_bW8DdjJKRtIRngqKEArQ4Rm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlog by authors\r\n\r\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/microservice-delivery-with-amazon-ecs-and-application-load-balancers/\r\nhttps://developer.capitalone.com/blog-post/delivering-microservices-for-enterprise-with-devops/\r\n\r\n","rating":100.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["cloud resiliency serverless","30-min tech talk"],"profile":{"name":"Sathiya Shunmugasundaram","bio":"Sathiya has been working in IT for the last 20 years.

Please find more information you have asked for below.\r\n\r\nWhat is your definition of chaos engineering?\r\n\r\nIn our definition, Chaos Engineering is a discipline where we will simulate real world failures which occur rarely and cause catastrophic losses to the systems. This is much more important in cloud environments where we have completely relinquished the infrastructure management and high level service management to the cloud provider. Traditional testing mechanisms do not cover such self inflicted failures. Using Chaos Engineering tools, applications can subject themselves to failures and measure their resiliency.\r\n\r\nHow do you commonly work with teams to improve their microservices?\r\n\r\nAs part of integration and performance testing of applications, we engage them and set them up with cloud detour, the chaos engineering tool. The application teams can then start registering various failures against the application and infrastructure. For example random termination of servers and high CPU simulation affecting the processes. This will help evaluate how the microservice performed against the failures and if it still met the NFRs.\r\n\r\nhow generally applicable the solution you use at Capital One is or whether it is highly specific to your needs\r\n\r\nThe solution is very generic for applications deployed in AWS. Any AWS deployed application will be able to use the various aspects of solution whether the application just uses Infrastructure services like EC2 or higher level application services like ECS/S3\r\n\r\nAdditional information on AWS and general availability\r\n\r\nThe tool received a great feedback in its initial pilot and currently being aggressively adopted by various divisions. Over next few months, we will be able to make it Open Source ready for the community use. Also one of our objectives is to build an abstraction layer over the capabilities and make it available in other cloud providers like Azure and Google cloud. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSathiya \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-22T03:04:34.247Z","updated_at":"2017-01-22T03:04:34.247Z"},{"id":4264,"submission_id":7834,"talk_id":14873,"user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Sathiya,\r\nThanks for your submission. I have a couple of suggestions: \r\n\r\n1. Your talk description does not mention automation anywhere. A conference participant who's not familiar with Chaos Monkey or \"chaos engineering\" may wonder if the approach being described is fully automated (on one end) or is about a strategy to \"manually\" engineer scenarios to test resiliency. Since today we pursue the \"automation of all things\", I think the description should say to what degree the solution uses automation and integrates to CI.\r\n\r\n2. You mention mission critical applications, but don't qualify the applications any further. You could be more specific in the description. For example, the solution may work for failure testing of services that expose http endpoints, but not for failure testing of services that consume JMS messages. \r\n","created_at":"2017-02-06T14:08:37.828Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T14:08:37.828Z"},{"id":4381,"submission_id":7834,"talk_id":14873,"user":{"name":"Sathiya Shunmugasundaram","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17dc934bfd849e2c5ee19de1cac59009?s=500","email":"sathiya.shunmugasundaram@capitalone.com"},"body":"Paulo - Great feedback, thank you.

We treat connectors as self-contained, physical (i.e. binary), identifiable special-purpose components that isolate interfaces from communicating components. We intentionally place interfaces contained in connectors in the forefront of any kind of component system. \r\n\r\nThrough interfaces in connectors, components can be supplied with extra-functional services, such as the monitoring and budgeting of system-resource usage, the profiling of architecturally relevant components, and the checking of communication protocols. These services are beneficial for industrial systems that are maintained and evolve in the field. Connectors are a means of realizing blue/green deployments, canary releases, and performance monitors; all of which are necessary for DevOps scenarios that work in industrial environments. Connectors take over these tasks. Components can focus on their core businesses.\r\n\r\nEven without any extra-functional services, connectors provide two significant advantages to the development and operation of resource-constrained, safety-critical embedded systems. Firstly, connectors physically decouple communicating components, in the sense that components depend on (reference) connectors but connectors do not depend on components. Secondly, for implementation connectors do not need heavyweight component frameworks or middleware as usually in distributed systems.\r\n\r\nConnectors can be built for and operated in rich runtime environments such as .NET CLR, and in thin runtime environments such as crt0 for C++ programs. Basically, for our purposes, build and runtime environments need only to support interfaces in the sense of the identically named language concept and linkable compilation units. To build connectors of different kinds, we use several techniques and design patterns of different pattern languages in various combinations, for example Factory, Strategy and Decorator from E. Gamma et al., Registry from M. Fowler, Bounded Context from E. Evans and Insulation from J. Lakos.\r\n\r\nThe presentation is divided into four parts. In the first part we introduce the minimal connector and explain the consequences and benefits for developing, testing and configuring component systems. In the second part we develop the minimal connector into light connectors containing plain interfaces (call and callback) and then into heavy connectors with additional extra-functional services. In the third part we apply connectors for structuring a system whose development follows the DevOps methodology. In the fourth and final part, with a better understanding of our motivation, objectives, nature, assemblage and application of connectors in our practice, we work out similarities and differences in comparison with the Interceptor pattern from D. Schmidt et al. and component-and-connector views (SEI: Documenting Software Architectures, 2nd ed.).","notes":"","abstract":"Physically independent connectors decouple components without performance costs.

I have a few comments on specific assertions you make in the talk description. \r\n\r\n1. \"We view software architectures as systems of connectors.\"  Well, architecture is more than that. The literature on software architecture today is clear to say that software architecture encompasses multiple *views* (or perspectives, viewpoints). An architecture view that shows the components (runtime elements) and connectors is one of them. But a view that describes, for example, how the source code is organized in layers, or packages, namespaces is also part of the software architecture. A view that shows how different components are allocated to different hardware elements or nodes is also part of the software architecture. A view that shows the data entities and their relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many) in a data centric information system is also part of the software architecture. So, I think this statement should be more flexible to say something like \"An important perspective of any software architecture is the one that shows a system of connectors.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"A connector is a self-contained, physical (i.e. binary), identifiable special-purpose component that isolates interfaces from communicating components.\"  There are overloaded definitions of components and connectors out there. I particularly like the ones in \"Documenting Software Architectures, Second Edition\". This book says a \"Components are the principal computational elements and data stores that execute in a system.\"  Then it says \"A connector is a runtime pathway of interaction between two or more components.\"  The book makes clear that connectors are first-class citizens in the software architecture. But your definition seems too strict. For example, when a Javascript web page (the client component) makes an http call to a REST service (the server component), I see the http communication as the connector. However, in my architecture I don't have a physical, binary, identifiable element for that connector.  I also find it confusing to say that a connector is a (type of) component. Conceptually, it's easier to separate components from connectors.\r\n\r\n3. \"Connectors are a means of realizing blue/green deployments, canary releases, and performance monitors\". Often times, performance monitoring, logging, and other similar functionalities are performed by interceptors. An interceptor is not a connector, it's a special type of component. It's special because it is not called directly, it does not have a visible interface; instead, the interceptor will \"listen\" to the communication and will intercept messages/calls/events of interest. In the example I mentioned (JS component talking to a REST service), an interceptor could intercept the http calls for monitoring, logging, routing, message transformation, security controls. \r\n\r\n4. \"Firstly, connectors physically decouple communicating components, in the sense that components depend on connectors but connectors do not depend on components.\"  The level of coupling actually varies based on the type of connector. For example, an EJB client component will use the EJB-specific RPC connector to call the EJB component. That EJB client is tightly coupled to the EJB. OTOH, if a Java component sends a message to a JMS queue and there is another Java component that consumes messages from that queue, these two components are indeed decoupled because of the presence of the message queue connector. \r\n\r\n5. \"In the third part we apply connectors for structuring a system whose development follows the DevOps methodology.\"  I'm thinking much of what you call connectors is actually about interceptors. A DevOps strategy asks for health and performance monitoring that is visible to Devs as well as Ops. Much of that functionality is achieved by interceptors often provided by tools such as API gateways, zabbix, etc. \r\n\r\nI'm being picky wrt the use of core architecture concepts, but your talk seems pretty sound and valuable. \r\n","created_at":"2017-02-07T12:53:05.916Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T12:53:05.916Z"},{"id":4392,"submission_id":8138,"talk_id":15470,"user":{"name":"Joachim Fröhlich, Florian Krautwurm, Markus Lachenmayr","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f17b85f0f3df832a3bfbce052a9e3ce8?s=500","email":"florian.krautwurm@gmail.com"},"body":"Dear Paulo,\r\n\r\nthank you for your valuable feedback.\r\n\r\nWhile not able to address all your points, we have improved the talk description, in particular regarding connectors and the interceptor pattern.\r\n\r\nWe focus indeed on physical connectors, first-class citizens in the software architecture. Reduced to the minimum, a connector in our practice only contains one or more related interfaces (types) without implementations, and a somewhat special factory.\r\nAs the name suggests, interfaces are between components. Interfaces do not belong to the components communicating through interfaces, locally or remotely, sequentially or in parallel. In fact, we argue that interfaces rather than components carry component-based systems of any kind -- not just of distributed systems or of systems that rely on generalized middleware (component frameworks) containing or enabling interceptors. These thoughts should point out particular properties and advantages of \"our\" connectors and some differences to interceptors and to Aspect-Oriented Programming as well. \r\n\r\nWe will compare and contrast related work, views, and approaches in the new fourth part of the presentation. It will reference the work of SEI on Component-and-Connector Views, Shaw and Garlan as well as that of Schmidt et al. and others.\r\n\r\nKind regards.","created_at":"2017-02-08T16:46:25.034Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T16:46:25.034Z"}]}},{"id":7980,"submission":{"id":7980,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-13T01:00:10.560Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T22:52:24.860Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh7w4jw3930","rating":75.0,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["continuous integration","continuous delivery","continuous deployment","devops"],"profile":{"name":"Suzie Prince","bio":"Suzie Prince is Head of Product for ThoughtWorks Products building pioneering tools for software development teams.\r\n\r\nShe practices continuous integration and continuous delivery everyday to deliver quality software to end users.\r\n\r\nShe likes pushing buttons to release software, feature toggles and user feedback.

We've done some preliminary calculations, that worked out to about 1 hour a day for a developer, another 2 hours for the tech lead (me) who was dealing with the deployment management, and about 10-20 hours a week between QA & Product.

Architecture validations are becoming part of the processes used by IT groups to ensure software quality, and architecture review knowledge, reference materials and trained resources are becoming increasingly available. \r\nContinuous customer feedback is the best way to validate a software product and indirectly its architecture. Unfortunately, the system needs to be fully delivered in order to get that valuable feedback, and the cost of adjusting a software architecture after the system has been delivered is usually very high. The objective of the architecture validation techniques we describe in this presentation is to ensure that the future system meets its business objectives and quality attribute requirements, without slowing down the pace of delivery associated with Continuous Delivery.\r\nArchitecture validations deal with far more than just the technical issues, since business drivers are a key force in shaping an architecture. One of the key benefits of continuous architecture validations is that they periodically review the relations between business goals and architecture. As a result, they ensure that the system is designed, built and delivered in a way that provides the greatest benefit for its stakeholders.\r\nThis presentation describes how our approach can be leveraged to validate architectures in any type of project, and especially in a Continuous Delivery project.  First we define what we mean by Architecture Validation. Then we focus  on when to conduct Architecture Validations. We then discuss the roles required in an Architecture Validation. We finally detail how we can conduct architecture validations by describing some industry recognized techniques such as questionnaire-driven approaches, scenario-based approaches (including SEI's ATAM) and decision-based approaches (such as DCAM).\r\nIn order to illustrate the concepts introduced in this presentation, we will use a real-life example of Continuous Architecture Validation, showing how various approaches can be combined to effectively validate a project.","notes":"Murat Erder (Deutsche Bank, London) will be a co-presenter. This presentation builds upon our presentation on Continuous Architecture at SATURN 2016, and is the result of significant research and practical and extensive experience in this field. Further details can be found in our \"Continuous Architecture\" book (Morgan Kaufman, Nov 2015), and especially in Chapter 6 of that book.\r\n     \r\nThe tentative outline of the presentation would be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction: Why do we need to continuously validate the architecture? ***Note: this section will introduce a case study which will be used throughout the presentation to illustrate the concepts \r\n \r\n2. What do we mean by ‘Architecture Validation’?***Note: this section will introduce the concept of Continuous Customer Feedback\r\n\r\n3. When do we need to validate the architecture?\r\n\r\n4. Who should validate?\r\n\r\n5. How should we validate?\r\n\r\n    a. Checklist-driven architecture validation\r\n\r\n    b. Scenario-Based architecture validation\r\n\r\n    c.

In this talk I discuss integrity on several levels: \r\n\r\nFirst, not all of the alternatives I present are actually a departure from persons or small groups driving the architecture. \"Marshalls\" are typically accountable for a cross-cutting concern spanning the whole system or big parts of it. They look after integrity in architectural approaches assotiated with security, performance or recurring technical problems with infrastructure etc. So the classic architect is splitted, but not in a functional fashion as the system itsself.\r\nAlso the approach of an architecture owner encapsulates important topics in one person. In this case it is a person with general overview, experience and a broad vision. He is more of a mentor and rises important topics. He isn't the one who decides and designs everything though. This is mapped to a team where he has the same possibilities and tools as everyone else. Conceptual Integrity is an important driver for him though. \r\nOnly one of the presented options goes without a person or team explicitly and foremost responsible for the architecture. \r\n\r\nSecond, the integrity of a system has big advantages in productivity, maintainability and derivatively in reliability, security and so on. Nevertheless it comes at a cost and many modern systems see conceptual integrity as a scale, where the maximum is not the ultimate goal. We could for instance define a minimum of common ground that works for a given project. Could be the deployment model, the general structure, the monitoring and security approaches and some interface standards. Inside these general rules a team could in fact develop solutions that are structured very differently and possibly use other technologies than other teams of the same project. Of course this poses problems in reusability and the other areas stated, on the other hand the teams can act on their own and usually deliver value faster. If the architectural drivers and the context allow it, a little less integrity could be optimal for a project.\r\n\r\nThird, even without an architect that predefines approaches and tactics we were able to achieve a good level of architectural integrity. Integrity is driven by a good engineering process, broad architectural knowledge, experimenting developers and some kind of \"natural selection process\". This selection process includes that good solutions are broadcasted to all teams and their adaptation is made easier. Bad ideas or the divergence from a known best practice should be harder to implement. In the acstract I call that \"low viscosity design\". Architecture then focuses on the identification of good approaches, the support of their communication and the creation of space to abstract good solutions and make them more universal. This is another form of architectural work as the \"standards-first\" approach, with arguably lower conceptual integrity, but often faster innovation, better flexibility and more realistic architectural concepts. A combination of top-down and bottom-up architectural approaches is a good fit for most projects I work on, low viscosity can shift the boundary a little in the bottom-up direction without causing direct chaos.\r\n\r\nAll of these topics are introduced in this talk, not all of them are covered in great detail. I am open to shifting the focus of the talk a bit if certain aspects sound very interesting for you.

While there is some work in this field, most of it has been devoted to metrics and estimates. Metrics are shadows of snowflakes, and thus not particularly informative when seeking to understand the purpose of a system or the behavior of a component. Improving estimation, while an interesting application and a laudable goal, likewise does not directly help developers create better software faster, nor manage the growing complexity of real-world systems. Can we apply ML in ways that help guide development, inform software archaeology, and reduce effort for developers? If so, can these things help us take on the systems-of-systems-of-systems of the future, where million-line code bases will be considered \"quaint\"?\r\nAfter a brief survey of existing/past work in the area, we'll investigate the question of \"what does software look like\", examine the more interesting question of \"what does good software look like\", and use these insights to explore how we can enable developers to create and manage ever-larger software systems. No ML experience or math required. Lots of pretty pictures.\r\n","notes":"I've been research the applications of AI/ML/DL to software development, and experimenting with some unique approaches specifically intended to aid software developers, including the notion of 'semantic drift' (the 'distance' between classes and stories in semantic space) and topic-based clustering of software subsystems as a guide to refactoring. This talk avoids complex math, instead offering an intuition for how the main deep learning approaches work and why they work, includes a lot of pretty pictures, and outlines some future directions in software development principles and practices.","abstract":"Most of the AI breakthroughs in the last 4 years have been the result of deep learning; but what, if anything can deep learning do to help software developers?","audience_level":"Intermediate","talk_format":"Tech Talks and Tech Tutorials (30 or 90 minutes - please specify the exact time in the Notes section)"},"ratings":[{"id":25987,"submission_id":6476,"value":100,"comments":"","created_at":"2017-01-24T04:11:19.481Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T04:11:19.481Z","user":{"name":"paul newell","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7dde0e8a75e3d6e85f81545dff623df4?s=500","email":"paul.newelljr@gmail.com"}},{"id":25512,"submission_id":6476,"value":50,"comments":"Pros - potentially novel cross fertilization of ideas from a hot research topic with software architecture\r\nCons - seems very immature and speculative, no explanation of why deep learning specifically is needed, lacks clear formulation as an ML problem, lacking proven practical value.","created_at":"2017-01-18T14:28:31.780Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T14:28:31.780Z","user":{"name":"Ian Maung","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff64ab17229b011d54c79df90d36dbd4?s=500","email":"ianmaung@yahoo.com"}},{"id":25257,"submission_id":6476,"value":100,"comments":"Relevant topic.

I am explicitly using domain-driven design structures (bounded contexts, context maps) married with semantic visualizations (topic maps derived from natural language processing word-vector vocabularies) as a yardstick for what \"good\" software looks like .\r\n- yes. My work in this area started because of a real problem: trying to quickly understand a 2-million-line codebase. I have applied earlier versions of the tools to real-world projects (e.g. mapping 72,000 stories and 8,000 classes into the same semantic space), and continue to do so.

REST over HTTP is a popular choice for microservices APIs because it promotes openness, self-discovery, and simplicity.  One alternative to REST is [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/), an implementation of Protobuf.  As an RPC-based API, gRPC inhibits openness and self-discovery but promotes performance and, depending on the implementation, can provide stronger compile-time (or at least call-time) guarantees which help developers avoid mistakes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will share our experiences migrating a REST-based microservice to gRPC, as well as lessons learned implementing gRPC APIs in a suite of backing microservices for the Watson Discovery Service.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, attendees will know\r\n\r\n* What gRPC is and how it is different from REST\r\n* How to organize code to make API transitions easier\r\n* The benefits of functional testing using Cucumber and tips for creating extensible gRPC API tests using Ruby\r\n* How to implement common REST patterns in gRPC\r\n* Common pitfalls for using gRPC in a microservices architecture and some solutions","notes":"This talk will have the following tentative outline.\r\n\r\n1.

Our architecture pattern languages have changed as have our development, deployment, and operating procedures (DevOps).  \r\n\r\nDuring this transition, one source of ideas has been the functional programming community.  Functional programming itself mostly happens within a module and indeed many software architects treat it as an implementation choice, unrelated to architecture.  But it turns out that some ideas from the FP community are helpful in architectural design: statelessness, immutability, and pure functions.  They underlie DevOps practices and are at the core of many distributed systems patterns at the core of our architectures.\r\n\r\n## Why now?  \r\nFunctional programming ideas have been around for a long time but conditions are ripe.\r\n\r\n1.  Coping strategy for complexity.  As systems get bigger but our brains stay the same size, we invent tech to cope.  Statelessness, immutability, and pure functions make it easier to reason about how a system behaves.\r\n2.  Problems grew in size.  No single computer big enough to run a system.  FP ideas suited to parallelism and concurrency, so many smaller computers can solve big problems.\r\n3.  We have more money than sense.  You can buy 100 cloud machines for less than one junior developer.  So why not do Continuous Integration with every source code commit?  Why not have a farm of servers running different versions of your code during deployments?  Why not burn RAM with immutable data structures?\r\n\r\n## Functional ideas in modern architectures\r\n\r\n1. Client-side.  Reactive patterns and frameworks.  Eg React, CycleJS, Elm.\r\n2. Server-side.  So-called \"serverless\" pure functions.  REST architectural style.  Reactive services.  Event queues between services.\r\n3. Persistence.  Append-only datastores.  Event sourcing & Command Query Response Segregation (CQRS).\r\n4. Batch sequential & pipeline architectures:  Big data processing (Hadoop, Spark), Map-Reduce, Tensorflow and other machine learning graph-based functional transformation.\r\n5. Devops infrastructure.  Version control everything (append-only).  So-called \"immutable\" and \"idempotent\" infrastructure set up by running code, not by Linux admins.\r\n\r\n## Reactive programming\r\n1. What is it?  Evolution of Observer pattern.  Observable = Observer pattern plus onError and onCompletion.  Hot and cold streams.\r\n2. Use in UI architectures.  Strong competitor to Model-View-Controller and sibling patterns.  \r\n\r\n## What you will learn in this talk\r\nThe amount of innovation and hype in web technologies is intense and often overwhelming.  If you haven't been staying current, this talk should give you a mental map to start your learning.  If you have stayed current, this talk should reveal how functional ideas weave throughout modern web architectures and perhaps provide insight into why they work.\r\n\r\nThe talk surveys how modern web systems are built with FP patterns.  It will dig into one client-side example and show how FP ideas can simplify this task.","notes":"I propose this as a 30-minute tech talk.  I can scale the material to fit into 22 mins + questions.\r\n\r\nI have plenty of material so I'm happy to do a 90-minute tech talk that digs into more details if you think the topic is sufficiently interesting.  90-minute slots are rare at SATURN, so I don't want to presume.  \r\n\r\nIf you think 90 minutes is better than 30, please consider this as a participatory session.  If the audience is really new to FP ideas, it can take time to see how to accomplish work using these patterns.  There is a great game we could play a few rounds of ([Cube Composer](http://david-peter.de/cube-composer)) to warm them up (go ahead and try it now).  Then we could design a system using event queues and discuss the quality attribute tradeoffs, or go further into the UI reactive example.","abstract":"Functional programming (FP) has invaded architectures.

I have a few suggestions/comments from the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program: \r\n\r\n1. One may look at the description and ask: 'Sounds promising. But we use scrum/agile development in a low ceremony way. Would this work for me?'  So, is this approach applicable to Agile development? With small co-located teams and short sprints? \r\n\r\n2. If I had to guess, I'd say that profiling the jobs and pains of the customers takes time and requires some modeling and documentation effort. My feeling from experience is that developers will not be very keen on doing that. How much automation can be employed in this process? How long does it take? Is it hours in facilitated meeting with stakeholders like in  QAW or ATAM?\r\n\r\n3. I see the value of the approach for companies that sell software products or products with software. Would it be equally attractive to enterprise IT? I work in enterprise IT for the government in an environment where this statement is not very appealing: \"build a plan that our sales and business colleagues understand\". \r\n\r\n(In the Notes you can use a blank line to make PaperCall render separate paragraphs.)\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-30T12:04:06.980Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T12:04:06.980Z"},{"id":3841,"submission_id":8078,"talk_id":15347,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Paulo,\r\nThank you for taking the time to write feedback! Let me give a short reply to your comments.\r\n\r\n1. It could very much be applicable, the products I used this on have only a handful of developers.

SATURN is also an architecture conference, so some planning effort should be ok.\r\n\r\n2. With three-four people knowledgeable about our business it took half a day to profile two customer groups in sufficient depth. Strategyzer very much encourages quick and iterative development of products. The methodology builds on posters with sticky notes and a whiteboard, tools I believe are popular in Agile teams.\r\n\r\n3. I work both with products and enterprise IT, so I believe I understand your concern. Yet enterprise IT also has customers, the business. Business users also have jobs that they try to accomplish for our company. Business decision makers are economic decision makers and thereby a customer that wants something done efficiently.

Leveraging this and other AWS services, it has become possible to build entire business applications in a secure, scalable fashion, without provisioning VMs or taking on the system administration tasks that entails. There has since been quite a bit of buzz around 'Serverless' development, with entire frameworks and tooling built to support such an approach. This talk is intended to discuss what the tradeoffs of taking such an approach are, how to technically execute on such an approach within AWS, and what my own experiences have been in building and running Serverless applications in production.","notes":"90 minutes\r\n\r\nAs the backend tech lead at Stanley Black and Decker I have led the development and deployment of multiple applications into production that rely entirely on Serverless backends, along with a hybrid legacy app that we are currently moving toward being Serverless. \r\n\r\nI intend to cover the basics of building REST interfaces on top of the AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda, delve into the tradeoffs of doing so, and then branch out into methods and considerations of data storage, access control (including authorization/authentication of users to your REST endpoints and other resources), continuous integration and development, messaging patterns (both solely on the backend, and between the backend and various user clients), backend generated events and triggers (i.e., responding to scheduled events, or building in logic to trigger additional behaviors outside of the context of a user request), and various best practices and considerations I've learned from my experiences.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this talk I will touch on the place of the following AWS services in a Serverless solution - Lambda, API Gateway, S3, Dynamo, RDS, Elasticache, IAM, Cognito, STS, SQS, SNS, IoT, CloudFormations, Cloudfront, Route 53.\r\n\r\nThe intended presentation mechanism is predominantly slides, with links to code and Cloudformations to illustrate less obvious implementation strategies  (i.e., not \"here's how to write a record to DynamoDB\", which is easily gleaned from API documents, but \"here's code demonstrating the usage of the AWS IoT platform as a websocket for sending arbitrary messages across\", or \"here's an example Cloudformation for setting up an existing lambda to execute periodically, and to include a dead letter queue to report errors to\". In general, my goal is not to give an end to end working example of everything I discuss (as that will be impossible to go over in detail in the time frame, and will be exceptionally contrived), but instead to go over enough to give people a high degree of confidence in speccing out their own projects, while also providing code or walk through an example for anything that did not strike me as inherently obvious on how to implement from glancing at AWS' documentation. \r\n\r\nTentative high level outline - \r\n\r\n1. API Gateway and Lambda - demonstrate a Serverless endpoint, wherein we can see arbitrary code execution in response to an HTTP POST, in the context of a Lambda, which simply parrots back the body and one or two headers, to show how they can be mapped into the function. Discuss using the API Gateway as a passthrough to an existing REST API, to allow for the swapping out, endpoint by endpoint, to a serverless one, in the event of a legacy app.\r\n\r\n2. Data storage options - largely high level discussion of considerations between Elasticache, DynamoDB, and S3 as storage mechanisms, in terms of cost, ease of use, and availability/consistency guarantees.\r\n\r\n3. Backend processing and user notification - Discuss lambda event sources and their implications (the ability to trigger lambdas from writes to Dynamo or S3, a brief foray into SQS as a distributed queue, and how things can fail, and what to do about them). Demonstrate using AWS IoT for websocket pushes to web clients (and mention GCM and APNS as still being available for pushing to mobile). Discuss SNS as an option to broadcast events to custom HTTP endpoints, or to send emails, as well as a possible way to send mobile push messages.\r\n\r\n4. Access Control - Discuss Cognito as an Amazon provided identity provider. Demonstrate how to go from a Cognito identity (or a custom identity, if using custom code to log someone in) to a set of temporary AWS credentials, that can be used to access resources. A brief foray into IAM policies (which control what a set of AWS credentials have access to). And how to leverage both IAM and AWS credentials to properly secure one's own REST API endpoints.\r\n\r\n5. CI/CD - Discuss some of the frameworks for developing and deploying serverless code to AWS. Demonstrate an example using the Serverless (http://www.serverless.com/) framework. Demonstrate Cloudformations as a way to define and port infrastructure between environments. Suggest the use of AWS Config and Cloudtrail to track changes. \r\n\r\n6. Monitoring - Dive into Cloudwatch. Demonstrate executing lambdas, navigating the resulting logs, exporting to S3 for ingesting into another tool. Demonstrate available metrics, and how to set up alarms. Discuss integration points with tools we've used.\r\n\r\n7. Latency and Cloudfront- Discuss latency of lambdas. How real it is, how to mitigate it, when to cache. Demonstrate setting up a Cloudfront instance in front of custom API, and when to use it vs the API Gateway's cache. \r\n\r\n","abstract":"This talk is to introduce Serverless computing, a new paradigm in the cloud for deploying applications that requires no server administration, and which scales transparently in both function and cost.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. The first sentence of the description implicates a causal relation that I believe doesn't exist (\"With the release of AWS Lambda and API Gateway, it has become possible to build RESTful interfaces without any server infrastructure in the cloud\").  One can build REST interfaces for enterprise systems on-premises for the intranet, without AWS Lambda or API Gateway. In any case, if you're using AWS Lambda, I think you *are* using cloud infrastructure, you just don't need to procure/manage/be aware of the servers.  \r\n\r\n2. In the notes you say \"I intend to cover the basics of building REST interfaces.\" Do you mean REST API design? That's a quite large topic on its own.  \r\n\r\n3. In addition to benefits, I think you should also discuss the challenges and drawbacks of serverless architecture. Such discussion flows naturally into motivation for and risks associated with serverless. \r\n\r\n4. A 90-minute long talk takes the time equivalent to 3 30-minute talks, so the info should be clearly valuable. Serverless is a hot topic this year and many people want to know what it is, if it's a good fit for them, what's the roadmap to 'go serverless'. I think your talk goes over all of that. Do you intend to talk about serverless outside AWS? For example, simple use of MBaaS for mobile app authentication?  \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6. What is \"event pipelining\"? Is there a more commonly used equivalent term? Maybe a term that's in wikipedia?  :^)\r\n\r\n7. Just to clarify, what's the presentation mechanics? Slide-based presentation end-to-end? Or do you plan  to have a demo?

Since then, I got a Software Architecture Professional Certification from SEI, and I have been constantly studying and teaching various domains of software engineering.\r\n\r\nI am highly passionate about software architecture, and I love teaching software engineering and mentoring developers, as well as coding in multiple programming languages. See [My LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adi-levin-0a0a614).\r\n\r\nI am also the submitter of a second talk, with the title **How to gain influence as a software architect**.\r\n\r\n##Talk outline\r\n\r\n 1. Present the challenge we faced\r\n  - Show video and give a description of the [iTero intra-oral Scanner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdI5Pp2dVTg)\r\n  - Explain the data model we use in earlier versions of iTero, and why it was inadequate for the new product\r\n 1. Present the basics of the architecture\r\n  - Define an \"Actor\"\r\n  - Explain how actors access data and communicate via a dispatcher: All of the shared state is made of immutable data, and any modification is done by creating a new object, and broadcasting it\r\n  - Explain the data model (each actor keeps a key-value dictionary, where the key-space is shared, and the values are pointers to reference-counted objects in the heap)\r\n  - Explain about publish-subscribe and event handlers\r\n 1. Explain how this architecture is different from the famous Actors Model\r\n  - Provide links to existing implementations [1](https://github.com/actor-framework), [2](http://www.theron-library.com/index.php).\r\n  - Explain how our model is based on shared state and publish-subscribe, while the Actors model is using private state and peer-to-peer messaging.\r\n 1. Discuss more aspects of the architecture\r\n  - Separation of concerns: Actors are responsible for message-passing and fetching data from the shared state, and they delegate computations to other objects that are tested in isolation\r\n  - How an actor is created: the role of the dispatcher in making sure that a newly created actor has access to the most up-to-date state\r\n  - A generic solution for persistence\r\n  - Cancellation of long-running operations\r\n  - Generic logging\r\n  - A generic Record/Replay feature\r\n 1. Discuss design trade-offs, and pros & cons of the architecture\r\n  - Pros: Safe concurrency, and ease of implementing complex logic\r\n  - Cons: Data model is flattened into a key-value dictionary, losing a natural hierarchy\r\n 1. Shortly discuss a possible improvement of the data model\r\n  - Use a persistent tree structure (as in [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)), instead of a flat key-value store, to restore the natural hierarchy of objects.","abstract":"We present a battle-proven architecture for lock-free concurrency control in multi-threaded C++ applications.

Actors and actor systems are an important architectural pattern that have been around for a while but seem to have gained more traction in the past few years with the rise of frameworks such as Akka and an increase in distributed systems.  I like that this talk explores a hybrid pattern that combines actors, pub-sub, and peer-to-peer.

What is the rationale behind the design decisions that were made?\r\n* Sections 4 and 5 could use some tightening.  I like the discussion of trade-offs but section 4 seems like a general bucket of ideas.  If accepted please think about how this section can be organized to better convey your message.\r\n\r\nOne thing to think about: one are the top 2 or 3 things that someone who attends your talk should be able to do that they couldn't do before?

This requires multiple threads to access large amounts of shared data for generating scans, refining them, repositioning them, rendering them and storing them to persistent storage - all simultaneously. This is why we chose to design a system where shared state can be accessed safely by collaborating threads. Pub-Sub was chosen because of the high complexity and the data-driven nature of the design (e.g. rendering is triggered when an object is changed, without the producer of the object having to communicate with the rendering actor; denoising and filtering algorithms are triggered when a new scan is created; etc...). Do you think this clarifies the motivation?\r\n\r\nIn answer to your comment about sections 4 & 5, I think I'll tighten this discussion by removing a couple of items from section 4 (the first two, probably), and incorporating the rest of them into the trade-offs discussion, showing how these aspects are added benefits: For example, the pub-sub nature, together with the dispatcher, enables a generic record/replay feature (like in Redux), and similarly, generic solutions for persistence and logging.\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees be able to do that they couldn't do before? They will be able to implement a data model that supports efficient and safe sharing of memory in a multi-threaded application. This is useful for complex systems. Also, they will learn the benefits of channeling all writes through a single thread (dispatcher), which provides total ordering of messages, and is one way of ensuring consistency in concurrent systems.\r\n\r\nWIth kind regards,\r\n\r\nAdi.","created_at":"2017-02-06T06:43:08.489Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T06:43:08.489Z"}]}},{"id":7302,"submission":{"id":7302,"state":"accepted","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2016-12-24T11:51:28.259Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T22:30:45.175Z","additional_info":"I have plenty of speaking experience, but, unfortunately, no video.","rating":100.0,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["communication","leadership","influence"],"profile":{"name":"Adi Levin","bio":"I'm a software developer, architect and mathematician.

An architect needs to form collaborations with different teams, often with different styles of working and planning, in order to clarify the project's scope and requirements, and then design the architecture and implement it.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, an architect needs to use all communication tools effectively: Meetings, architecture drawings, written documentation, design reviews, code reviews and informal conversations. In every opportunity, an architect should encourage the engagement of other stakeholders and must learn how to deal effectively with their concerns, and, in particular, how to deal with opposition and with conflict.\r\n\r\nBut communication techniques and technical excellence combined are not sufficient for sustainable effective leadership. To gain trust and credibility, one has to display consistent personal values and character ethics, and build relationships that are based on integrity and commitment.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share with you my own experiences and lessons learned from years of working as a software architect in a global organization, and from studying dozens of the greatest writings from the field of business, leadership and communication.","notes":"##Primary track\r\n\r\nI propose this talk for the track **\"Other topics of interest\"**, since the lessons learned here are applicable to a wide range of circumstances, and are not related to any technology or software trend.\r\n\r\n##Session type\r\n\r\nThis talk falls into the category of **\"Experience Report Presentation\"** (30 minutes, describing first-hand experiences and lessons learned). It is entirely based on my own experience, and the lessons I have learned in the past 4 years working in a global organization, gaining the trust and cooperation of stakeholders of all kinds.\r\n\r\n##About me\r\n\r\nI have a Ph.D. in mathematics and plenty of experience giving lectures. I have given 14 talks in international math conferences, including 2 Siggraph talks ([Siggraph 2006](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1141990), [Siggraph 1999](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=311541)). After 15 years of leading algorithms teams, I decided to become a software architect, 4 years ago. Since then, I got a Software Architecture Professional Certification from SEI, and I have been constantly studying and teaching various domains of software engineering. In addition, I have spent numerous hours studying the literature on leadership, personal growth, effective communication and influence, and I have successfully applied the techniques and principles to my work.\r\n\r\nThis will be my first talk in an international conference on software architecture. I created this talk after years of successful technical leadership in a global organization, gaining credibility with many people from remote locations and from various disciplines, in domains where I was often not an expert.\r\n\r\nI am also the submitter of a second talk, with the title **High-Performance Multi-Threaded Immutable Store for C++**.\r\n\r\n##Main theme\r\n\r\n***Collaboration is power; Be genuinely interested in the concerns and challenges of others; Include them generously; Act with integrity***\r\n\r\nAll of the stories, insights, and tips that I share have the above theme in common. For example: When talking about effective online meetings, I share how useful it is to reflect people's concerns in writing and in real-time, as a way to verify that their concerns are understood correctly, and to give them the feeling that they have been heard; When naming components, I recommend to include others in choosing their names, as a way to encourage their collaboration; For dealing with opposition, I recommend to focus on a better understanding of the opposing party; On dealing with difficulties, I emphasize that this is the time to make extra efforts and display personal integrity, by being there for the developers, and by admitting and correcting one's own mistakes.\r\n\r\nWhile those messages are all relevant to any leadership situation, I believe they are especially useful for software architects, whose effectiveness relies upon their ability to form a collaboration, often without the benefit of a position of authority.\r\n\r\n##Talk outline\r\n\r\nThe talk will be filled with personal stories and examples from my own experience. The audience will be given a set of techniques that anyone can implement and principles that anyone can follow.\r\n\r\n1. Challenges facing a software architect (based on my own experience):\r\n  * Remote teams\r\n  * Some teams not communicating well with one another\r\n  * Teams not used to working with a designated software architect\r\n  * Stakeholders from very different time zones\r\n  * Different cultures of different teams; different levels of agility\r\n  * Poorly documented legacy systems that need to evolve\r\n  * Different opinions about whether to build or to buy\r\n  * Unclear project scope\r\n  * Unclear requirements\r\n  * Stakeholders with prior commitments, who don’t have time to spend on your project\r\n  * Tasks that require designing a kind of system that you have never designed before\r\n1. How to recognize that you have influence?\r\n  * Your designs come to life\r\n  * People ask for your advice on various projects outside your area of responsibility\r\n  * People want you to help them resolve disagreements\r\n  * People tend to accept what you propose\r\n  * People are copying your documentation style\r\n  * People welcome your participation in meetings on any topic\r\n1. Effective meetings (especially remote meetings)\r\n  * Different kinds of meetings require smaller or larger groups\r\n  * Declare the goal of a meeting\r\n  * Publish agenda and slides up-front\r\n  * Phrase questions to be answered during the meeting\r\n  * Capture people's comments and opinions in writing and display in real-time them during the meeting\r\n  * Finish in time, and share meeting notes with people\r\n1. Effective architecture views to bring out the essence of an architecture\r\n  * Depending on the audience, it is often better to present a simple and concise drawing, as opposed to complete sets of architecture views\r\n  * Define names of components/modules/classes and their responsibilities. The other things follow from that. \r\n  * Naming something is an act of leadership. Declaring the name that someone else chose is even stronger. \r\n1. Use written documentation - this is especially important in a big and global organization\r\n  * Writing is hard for people, so there’s an opportunity to stand out here\r\n  * Make information accessible\r\n  * Become the source of information by summarizing it better than others do\r\n1. Encourage the engagement of others\r\n  * Seek the subject matter experts and do 1:1 discussions with them\r\n  * Look for opportunities to incorporate the ideas of others. If you accept someone’s idea, they will be more understanding next time you reject one of their ideas. \r\n  * Look for opportunities to show honest appreciation to other people’s contribution\r\n1. Dealing with opposition, rejections and unknowns\r\n  * If someone opposes an idea, ask questions about it - don’t just insist - regardless of how strongly you feel about your solution\r\n  * Never get attached to a design. Recognize that there are multiple solutions and analyze both the benefits and the cost of any design decision\r\n  * Seek first to understand, and only then to be understood \r\n  * When it is not clear how to make progress, phrase specific questions to be answered and ask for people's help\r\n1. Build personal relationships with stakeholders\r\n  * Get to know people on a personal level\r\n  * Seek opportunities to show your appreciation\r\n1. Be there for developers, after handing off the design to them\r\n  * There will be unanswered questions and difficulties\r\n  * Be there in weekly meetings and sprint planning\r\n  * Notice the conversations between teams, and help where it's needed\r\n1.

If you need to shorten the presentation, I suggest dropping or shortening topics 1, 3, and 8. \r\n\r\nThis sentence is not OK to me: \"Depending on the audience, it is often better to present a simple and concise drawing, as opposed to complete sets of architecture views.\"  Here's how I think (based on \"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition\"): \r\n- a software architecture is described as a set of architecture views. There isn't a single diagram that shows everything.\r\n- you should only create an architecture view if it has clear value to stakeholders (the audience for the software architecture).\r\n- a given architecture view may consist of a simple and concise drawing. \r\n\r\nThe following sentence is not clear to me: \"Declaring the name that someone else chose is even stronger.\"\r\n\r\nIn the talk outline, item (4) recommends: \"Define names of components/modules/classes and their responsibilities. The other things follow from that.\"\r\nI think having expressive names for software elements is important, but that recommendation alone is not very helpful. In fact, item (4) is about effective architecture views and there are so many important recommendations under this topic, such as:\r\n- Use a notation key in your diagrams (or indicate what standard notation you're using).\r\n- Use different symbols for different types of elements and relations. \r\n- Use consistent symbology across diagrams. \r\n- If you're using a pattern in your design, name it. If the reader is familiar with the pattern, he/she will understand the design more easily.\r\n- Use a template (standard organization) for your documentation. In particular, use the same template for all architecture views. (Subsections in a template may be N/A of course.)\r\n- Keep the information up-to-date. If you can't update the documentation, discard, archive or mark it as out-of-date.\r\n- Complement structural diagrams (e.g., UML class diagram) with behavior diagrams (e.g., UML sequence diagram).\r\n- Record the rationale for important design decisions.\r\n- Avoid ambiguity; write from the reader's point of view; review the documentation. \r\nThese recommendations can be found in the book I mentioned above (\"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition\").\r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n- Notes: \"trust and cooperation of *of* stakeholders\"\r\n- Notes: \"Capture people’s comments *opinions* in writing \"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-04T18:57:06.728Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T18:57:06.728Z"},{"id":3090,"submission_id":7302,"talk_id":13936,"user":{"name":"Adi Levin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1cc0aaebe6a196f253e61d0454edf59?s=500","email":"adi.4694252@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks for the thorough review, Paulo. I am going to use it to improve the presentation, and I am taking this opportunity to clarify my proposal.\r\n\r\nMy emphasis in this presentation will be on the human relations aspects and how they affect the level of influence of a software architect. \r\n\r\nYour comments about the architectural views are correct, and I should rephrase my intent: All of the architectural views are important for reasoning about a system's structure. I am not presenting a different theory of documenting software architecture, but I am commenting about the way in which I would present those architectural views to different stakeholders. In presentations, we often don't have time to go through all of the views; also, we may do it in a more constrained environment of online remote meetings, so we need to focus on the things that yield the most understanding and buy-in from the stakeholders. \r\n\r\nIn this context, I claim that naming and stating the responsibilities of a component or a module, is of especially high value.  The list of responsibilities is a concise representation of the intent of the designer, which helps stakeholders review the architecture and ask good questions about it (e.g. \"if this component is only responsible for X, then how come it depends on Y\"?).\r\n\r\nOne way to make the most out of architectural discussions is to find opportunities where other people contribute. A very powerful application of this is when we name software elements. By asking someone else: \"How would you name this component?\" and accepting the name that they offer, we make them our partners in the project. Similarly, if someone proposes a modification and we accept it, we gain more of their their cooperation, and it will be wise to give credit to the contributors. \r\n\r\nMy plan is to share other insights of this kind. This complements the more technical aspects of analysis, design and documentation, with wisdom that comes from the realm of leadership, effective communication and personal growth, and I have lots of relevant stories from my personal experience, which I think will be highly beneficial to the audience.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I will need to shorten some of the topics - and I will shorten topics 1 & 3, as your proposed.

Thanks for the kind words and for your review.\r\n\r\nHere is my context: I have been leading, and am still leading the technical design of a number of projects:\r\n\r\n1. An application for a 3D intra-oral scanner (http://www.itero.com/en) - there were ~20 developers working on it, divided to 4 teams in two locations (Israel and Moscow). Made of C++, C#, high performance algorithms and 3D graphics, interacting with proprietary hardware and real-time components.\r\n\r\n2. A HIPAA-compliant, scalable and highly available cloud-based storage system distributed in multiple data centers with integrations to ~10 applications. Involves ~6 development teams from 4 locations (East coast, West coast, Israel and Moscow), and other stakeholders from 3 more locations. Made of Java, NoSQL database, public cloud storage, REST API, caching layers, custom replication and workflow management, and a challenging data migration and transition strategy.\r\n\r\n3. A scalable and highly available cloud-based architecture for enhancing web applications by server-side algorithms, with interactive-rate messaging between the web page and the dedicated server-side process. Involves 3 teams from 2 locations + stakeholders from 2 more locations. Made of Java, Websocket, REST, elastic cloud-based cluster, with fully automated deployments.\r\n\r\n4. (Currently in early stages:) A cloud-based service for capturing, storing, displaying and manipulating doctor prescriptions. Emphasizes modifiability. Made of React, Java REST API, and document-oriented DB in the cloud.\r\n\r\nI am also involved in multiple other projects related to identity management & authentication, cloud-based workflow management, storage, data analytics, cluster computations, and others.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nRegarding your main feedback: You're right - my presentation should focus on a few key messages. I think those will be:\r\n\r\n1) Ways to get other people more engaged - this includes effective meetings, especially long-distance on-line conference calls, in which I have plenty of experience and success. For example, I want to demonstrate how I capture and display people's comments in real-time, and how satisfying this is to the participants: They know they are understood, and they know their opinion is heard, even when it is not accepted; Another example is getting people involved in the early stages of giving names to components.\r\n\r\n2) Ways to deal with difficulty and opposition: being open to others' ideas; listening, and truly caring about the concerns of others; not being attached to a specific solution, and being ready to challenge your own ideas; This doesn't mean giving up on good design solutions: It means that you should be willing to explain both the advantages and the trade-offs in the design, not in order to defend it at all cost, but in order to truly search for the best solution, thereby laying the foundation for better collaboration in the future, regardless of whose opinion ends up being accepted.\r\n\r\n3) Building long-term credibility. \"They don't care how much you know until they know how much you care\" - show commitment by being there when things are not clear, by allocating time for review and demo sessions; by providing specific feedback on detailed design decisions; by being there when teams disagree and need someone to resolve the dispute; by showing the appreciation and giving credit generously to others; And by admitting and correcting your design mistakes as soon as those come up.\r\n\r\nI will also give useful references to literature, where people can learn more about influence & leadership.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOn a personal note: I attended Saturn 3 years ago. It was one of the best conferences I have ever attended, and I still remember some of the great presentations (Especially the keynotes by Dianne Marsh and Joe Justice; The course by Robert Wojcik; Scott Hanselman's great talk; And others...). I will be honored and deeply excited to be among this excellent group of speakers.\r\n\r\nThis talk is not finalized yet. I have so many stories and references to share. I am planning to use the reviewers' feedback, and to do my absolute best to make this a great presentation worthy of the high level of this conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-07T18:29:55.807Z","updated_at":"2017-01-07T18:29:55.807Z"},{"id":3633,"submission_id":7302,"talk_id":13936,"user":{"name":"Anthony Tsakiris","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/646a039dcf3a2c4434f8fdf6c962b902?s=500","email":"adt2@speakeasy.net"},"body":"Thank you for your submission.

This presentation suggests a simple process you can follow to perform a rapid assessment of any software architecture effort regardless of its size, complexity or stage of development. The focus is on capturing the most critical aspects of the software architecture including: (a) Software Quality Attributes; (b) Key Architectural Decisions (including hardware platforms, software technology, development tools and reuse strategy); and (c) Architectural Design (primarily in the form of Unified Modeling Language or UML). Emphasis is placed on identifying and documenting references to existing artifacts. It generally requires an interview with the most knowledgeable software engineer on the proposal, development or maintenance team to identify the location of artifacts that are available and information that has never been documented. This is basically a two-day process. On the first day information is gathered and quickly recorded. On the second day, the information is analyzed, expert opinion(s) formulated, and a report is prepared and disseminated to all of the relevant Stakeholders. The process is a simple and straightforward mechanism for capturing software architecture and rapidly performing a valuable assessment during any time in the lifecycle of the product.

The involved systems fulfill valid purposes in their own right, can operate separately and are managed for their own purpose rather than the purposes of the whole.\r\n\r\nAllocation of business functions to specific system components and definition of interfaces with significant consequences for architecture of such large and complex IT and software system-of-systems (SoS) is a challenge. It requires data supporting decision criteria and accommodating fast evolution of the architecture in the agile organization.  \r\n\r\nRoche Customized Method of Architecting SoS \r\n===========================================\r\n\r\nFor the architecting of the system-of-systems in Roche product context a customized method was defined based on the US Department of Defense Architecture Framework.\r\n\r\nThis method involves 6 steps with start/finish criteria and deliverables for each. I will illustrate these steps using examples from Roche.\r\n\r\n1.  Business process Domain Analysis (identification of Business Drivers, Business Capabilities, Business Functions, Constraints, elaboration of User Stories and Workflows, definition of Quality Attributes).\r\n\r\n2.  Integrated Dynamic Modeling (IDM) for multiple workflows within the business process.\r\n\r\n3.  Derivation of Events, Activities and Resources for each workflow IDM.\r\n\r\n4.  Alignment to elaborate Common Events, Common Activities and Common Resources for all modelled workflows.\r\n\r\n5.  Identification of existing/overlapping/missing functionality (based on Activities) and data and processors (based on Resources) in involved systems. Preliminary allocation of the functions to the systems and verification of fulfillment of Business Criteria (based on Domain Analysis).\r\n\r\n6.  Architecting of data, process, deployment, … models and preliminary design of interface between the involved systems.  Verification of Quality Attributes fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThis method can be applied in agile projects, if the sprints are oriented on implementation of workflow.\r\n\r\nResults of application of the method at Roche\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\nThe customized method for the architecting of system-of-systems was applied to business processes related to Remote Solutions and IoT. It led to quick definition of models and derived data supporting the decision making and allocation of business functions and resources to existing and to be developed systems as well as identification of common resources and interfaces for their exchange. \r\n\r\n","notes":"As author of this method and part of the team applying it in the real world large scale projects I can give the practitioners view and probably answer most of questions. \r\nMy talk at the SATURN 2016 related to multiple ATAMs gave a short introduction to a small subset of the entire system.","abstract":"Customized method for making architecture decisions of allocation business functions to specific components of the system-of-systems and definition of interfaces for large and complex IT and software.  \nThis method of 6 steps with start/finish criteria for each was successfully applied at Roche.","audience_level":"All","talk_format":"Experience Report Presentation (30 minutes)"},"ratings":[{"id":27470,"submission_id":7950,"value":100,"comments":"","created_at":"2017-01-30T12:38:56.192Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T12:38:56.192Z","user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"}},{"id":27214,"submission_id":7950,"value":100,"comments":"I like that he's introducing the method (whose components won't be new to SATURN audience) and the real business application.

I have a few suggestions/comments from the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program: \r\n\r\n1. You say \"million connection points\" to characterize a large scale system. Would there be a different metrics unit people are more familiar with? LOC maybe? \r\n\r\n2. I hope you use examples to explain each of the steps. In fact, if you do so, I think you should say that in the description, that is, say something like... \"using real-life examples, I'll explain the 6 steps...\"\r\n\r\n3. One may look at the description and ask: 'Sounds promising. But we use scrum/agile development in a low ceremony way. Would this work for me?'  So, is this approach applicable to Agile development? With a small co-located team working on a single system and doing short sprints? If not, that's ok. If you see value, you may want to mention that in the description.\r\n\r\n3. If I had to guess, I'd say that some of these steps take time and require significant modeling and documentation effort. My feeling from experience is that developers will not be very keen on doing that. How much automation can be employed in the process? How long does it take? Is it hours in facilitated meetings with stakeholders like in QAW or ATAM?  Maybe the description can say something about the feasibility and cost required to use the process. \r\n\r\n4. The second paragraph is one long sentence. If you break it up it gets easier to parse.\r\n\r\n5. Just terminology: what you describe in step 1 as business process domain analysis seems to focus on functionality. To me that's business process modeling. To me domain analysis would necessarily encompass definition of business entities. An example of technique for domain analysis would be Eric Evans' DDD.  \r\n\r\n6. By the way, how are business capabilities different from business functions? If they're close enough, you can remove one to make the talk description shorter. \r\n\r\n\r\nTypo: \"and derived data*,* supporting the decision making ** and allocation \"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-30T12:37:09.362Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T12:37:09.362Z"},{"id":3932,"submission_id":7950,"talk_id":15115,"user":{"name":"Andrzej Knafel, Ph.D.","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ad6ad0b2d3de9e777d1f16d79c14132c?s=500","email":"andrzej.knafel@roche.com"},"body":"Hi Paulo\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your comments.

Similarly, microservices are expanding from being used mostly for green-field web services to being used in the enterprise - as organizations explore ways to decompose their monolith to support faster release cycles.\r\n\r\nRunning microservices-based applications in a containerized environment makes a lot of sense – both for Build and Test, as well as from a runtime perspective in Production.\r\n\r\nDocker and Microservices are natural companions, forming the foundation for modern application delivery. However, managing microservices and large-scale Docker deployments pose unique challenges for enterprise IT.\r\n\r\nThis talk discusses the modern requirements for building, deploying and operating microservices on a large-scale Docker-ized infrastructure. It covers:\r\n\r\n• Patterns for microservices-based architectures\r\n• What makes Docker such a good fit for microservices\r\n• How to operationalize Docker orchestration, auto-scaling and DR in large-scale Production environments – recommended typologies and patterns\r\n• Best practices for Docker configuration and registry management to ensure consistency throughout the pipeline and stability in Production\r\n• Tips for integrating containers into complex existing environments, supporting the hybrid state of microservices and monolithic applications\r\n• Tips and tooling for monitoring and managing clusters of containers as a single distributed application\r\n• Putting an end to Shadow-IT: how can IT enable Dev and Ops to use Docker for both microservices and traditional application releases - while ensuring visibility, security, governance and compliance\r\n","notes":"This talk was developed as a joint session with Electric Cloud CTO, Anders Wallgren: Anders Wallgren is chief technology officer at Electric Cloud.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. I work in enterprise IT. In our organization, all new IT software projects now use microservices and docker, but more than half of the developers have not yet created anything in this new world. Many organizations are in a similar situation. I hope in your talk you make a reflection about what are the benefits of moving to microservices and containers, and what are the challenges and risks. Talks on this topic typically emphasize the good things, but often neglect to mention the difficulties. \r\n\r\n2. One of the topics is \"Tips for integrating containers into complex existing environments, supporting the hybrid state of microservices and monolithic applications.\" I hope you explain what would be the motivation and criteria to move existing complex monolithic application to containers. We have for the moment discarded that option in our organization because of cost and complexity. We have found it useful at times to take cuts of a monolith and repackage as containerized microservices that expose http endpoints though.\r\n\r\n3. Minor point... Your last topic is \"Putting an end to Shadow-IT.\"  Here's what wikipedia says about shadow IT: \"Shadow IT is a term often used to describe information-technology systems and solutions built and used inside organizations without explicit organizational approval. It is also used, along with the term 'Stealth IT', to describe solutions specified and deployed by departments other than the IT department.\" So, people using gmail instead of the corporate email system is \"shadow IT\", and I see how that's a problem. But it seems this derogatory term also applies to software applications developed by non-IT groups. Well, I think that's a great idea if put forth with some direction. My organization has had for years a successful program for decentralized software application development. Many end users now develop great solutions, and are given access to IT-managed databases when needed.  \r\n\r\n4. The term visibility is not clear to me in \"while ensuring visibility, security, governance and compliance\".\r\n\r\nTypo: \"recommended t*o*pologies and patterns\".\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T14:21:15.541Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T14:21:15.541Z"}]}},{"id":8029,"submission":{"id":8029,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-14T01:22:59.118Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:47:28.004Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":90.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["30-minute-talk","micro services architecture"],"profile":{"name":"Sairam Tadigadapa","bio":"\r\n\r\nI am a Director of Software Engineering at Capital One.

My focus in on Marketing and Decisioning Technologies. I am in their Richmond, VA location.  I lead a team of 70 engineers developing architecture, building APIs and devops platforms. Over the last couple of years we built several mission critical APIs most of them are for customer facing and highly regulated capabilities. We learnt a lot breaking a monolithic application into micro services. I led delivery of several enterprise APIs and deployed into production. Hope to share my experiences in the session. I will also have some time for questions and answers at the end. The talk should last for 30 min.\r\nI will be explaining the following success factors and considerations\r\n\r\nWhy did we go with micro services?\r\n\r\nThe initiative that I led was a regulatory project for Know Your Customer (KYC) regulation. It has very tight timelines and dependencies across the organization. The best way we could have accomplished the timelines is to go with a microservices architecture. So the business drivers for microservices architecture are\r\n\r\n- Ability to break the solution into manageable micro services and have small teams solve them. That increased the speed of development by taking advantage of public cloud, strong devops, and automated testing\r\n- To drive accountability and ownership in a cross enterprise initiative\r\n- We also wanted to break some capabilities away from a monolithic application that was getting difficult to change\r\n\r\nSo, it is the business imperatives that drove us towards the micro services architecture.\r\n\r\nIn general, if it is a differentiating capability for the business (say credit decisioning for a bank) and agility is important, microservices approach helps. If it is not a differentiating capability like payroll and HR, better stick to a vendor product.\r\n\r\nArchitecture:\r\n\r\n- When re-architecting a monolithic application, we achieved better success starting with the head (or customer facing functions) of the monolithic application. As we get deeper there will be more dependencies making it difficult to decompose the application.\r\n- It is important to Identify the business capability and design the contract accordingly. The architecture should be aligned with product owner and it should clearly articulate the problem the specific micro service is solving.\r\n- Use domain driven design as much as possible. It is important to define the domain and the bounded context for the micro service. This also helps to define the granularity of the micro service. If the service is too big, it replicates the monolithic. Maintainability and agility should be kept in mind while designing the micro service. Our definition of a bounded context was driven by the following:\r\n  - Autonomy of the domain, its business context, and self-contained data store without need for replication across microservices\r\n  - The domain is simple to explain\r\n  - In one instance performance dictated its domain. We separated a high performing calculation engine as its own microservice and developed it in GO language.\r\n- Architect should focus on the API contract, interplay of micro services, and ensuring the non-functional requirements are met. It is important for the architect to know where to stop in the design\r\n- What you design for real time may not work for batch. We first designed the microservices for real time first with a requirement of low throughput. But when we started using the microservices for batch use cases that had a higher throughput requirement, the infrastructure design did not work. So, we had to tune and scale up the microservices.\r\n- While building individual microservices was easy, orchestrating the services wasn&#39;t easy. We built Java orchestrations, but very soon the orchestration services became too big to manage. We are experimenting with reactive frameworks.\r\n\r\nDevops :\r\n\r\n- Benefit of micro services is speed of development. Unless the code migration and deployment is automated, it is difficult to manage a micro services factory\r\n- Automate integration testing and performance testing. We built automated testing for individual APIs, but did not build automated integration scripts. That became a bottleneck at the end as we had to do manual testing.\r\n- With micro services, there will be frequent release. Hence, doing blue green deployment helps to minimize the down time\r\n- A cloud first approach works better for micro services\r\n- ATDD is a mandatory practice for micro services\r\n\r\nBest practices and culture:\r\n\r\n- Encourage Small teams of 4-5. If a micro service takes more than 1-2 developer to understand fully, it is too big and will become unmanageable\r\n- Encourage pair programming\r\n- Encourage knowledge sharing. Leverage demos to ensure teams get the big picture. Otherwise, developers will know only their micro service and miss the big picture. We moved away from separate production support teams. Teams support what they build. When we deployed the microservices into production, initially it was difficult to support as developers did not have the entire architecture context.\r\n- With small teams, teams slowly have to graduate to full stack teams that can do everything the micro service needs.\r\n\r\nCommunication to stakeholders:\r\n\r\n- It is important to communicate to clients often and in detail. Write a blog and publish every detail\r\n- Version management is critical\r\n- Contract first design helps in better communication\r\n\r\nOther practical considerations\r\n\r\n- Level of granularity is very important. Be ready to redefine and re-architect often as you go along\r\n- It is impossible to have a separate support team to whom you hand off the micro- sevices after they are built. The eco system gets more complex for some other team to own manage. integrate support into delivery teams\r\n- Alerting and monitoring is extremely important. Automate to the extent delivery teams spend less than 10% of their time on production support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","abstract":"This talk will explain  lessons learnt with micro services architecture, what are the key success factors like cloud, devops, domain driven design, and the practical considerations like production support issues and increased complexity.\n","audience_level":"All","talk_format":"DEV@SATURN Talk (15 minutes)"},"ratings":[{"id":27153,"submission_id":8029,"value":100,"comments":"","created_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:18.406Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:18.406Z","user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"}},{"id":26820,"submission_id":8029,"value":100,"comments":"This looks like a great session based on experience at an established organisation, full of good advise","created_at":"2017-01-27T14:23:00.887Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T14:23:00.887Z","user":{"name":"Chris Cooper-Bland","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f238825a57dff36da715f337d78053ec?s=500","email":"ccb@badgerscroft.com"}},{"id":25470,"submission_id":8029,"value":50,"comments":"this looks like a great experience report with a lot of good advice.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. For reflection: not everybody who's creating microservices uses DDD. What's in DDD that helps to define the best size (actually, the most appropriate functional scope) for a microservice? \r\n\r\n2. Should all microservices match DDD BCs? \r\n\r\n3. What are the challenges of using microservices? Is microservice architecture the best option in all cases? If not, in what situations a more monolithic approach works better? \r\n\r\n4. It seems your lessons learned derive from redesigning (breaking up) a monolithic application into microservices. What's the motivation for doing that? In the organization I work for, new projects are using microservices. However, for the moment, we have discarded the option of redesigning monolithic applications into microservices because of cost and complexity. We have found it useful at times to take cuts of a monolith and repackage as containerized microservices that expose http endpoints though. \r\n\r\n5. You say \"Benefit of micro services is speed of development\". I don't disagree, but I hope you can explain why in your talk. As food for thought, I wrote a [blog post](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2015/11/microservices-beyond-the-hype-what-you-gain-and-what-you-lose.html) about benefits and challenges of microservices.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. The relation between agile development and architecture work has been examined and discussed for a decade. I'm curious to see your OODA approach. Indeed, I think you should name it in the talk description and make sure it is well described in the talk. \r\n\r\n2. As a sanity check, ask yourself if the approach works well for geographically distributed and/or outsourced teams. Also ask if it requires developers who are well versed in software design (in addition to architects who can code of course). \r\n\r\n3. Years ago I gave an interview to InfoQ. One of the questions was exactly about the topic of your talk. I'll reproduce here my answer. It's just food for thought for preparing your presentation...  \r\n\r\n\"It is a well known misconception that agile development means no documentation. In fact, as a [survey shows](http://www.ambysoft.com/surveys/modelingDocumentation2008.html), agile teams are more likely to model than traditional teams. A few things that agile architects (or perhaps any software architect) should remember: \r\n\r\nThe key aspect of design/modeling in agile projects is not to avoid designing, but to avoid \"big-design up-front\" (BDUF). In general, high-level architectural strategies should be worked out up front, but many design decisions and design details can be left to when you need them. \r\n\r\nOnly produce design documentation that will fulfill a need of the stakeholders. Stop designing as soon as you're ready to start coding. In the next sprint you can expand/refine the existing design as needed in order to capture design decisions required by next sprint's features. \r\n\r\nIf it's not worth updating the design, throw it away. Some design diagrams are used to guide implementation, but at the end the code sometimes looks different from the diagram. If you don't have time to update the diagram to reflect the implementation, it's better to remove it than keeping an out-of-date diagram that may confuse a future reader. \r\n\r\nMany times, sketches are all you need. Don't spend too much time crafting the neatest diagram using the latest and richest notation available. Don't spend too much money on sophisticated modeling tools if you just need a drawing tool. In many agile projects, especially the ones with small, co-located teams, the true value of design diagrams comes from drawing them, which forces you to think through the issues; once the issues are solved, the diagrams lose much of their value. Many times the design is represented as a sketch on a whiteboard or piece of paper. If the sketch can be used to successfully convey the design to the team, that sketch, as is, can be *the* diagram in your architecture view. Why not?\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T16:21:52.816Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T16:21:52.816Z"}]}},{"id":7920,"submission":{"id":7920,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-11T21:00:19.114Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:55:02.620Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":80.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["code-quality"],"profile":{"name":"G.

Cognitive Complexity solves the problem, and returns \"fair\" relative measurements of control flow complexity. \r\n\r\nIn this session, you'll learn what the Cognitive Complexity methodology is, and why you should add it to your metric suite, see how it applies to a number of code samples from open source projects on SonarQube.com, and learn how to use a method's Cognitive Complexity score as a guide to designing better code, and refactoring existing code to be simpler and, more maintainable. You'll also see that because there's no \"cost of entry\" / increment for methods, high class-level Cognitive Complexity is a reliable indicator that a class contains a lot of logic, not just a lot of methods. That is, you can use Cognitive Complexity to sift domain classes from the logic-intense classes that impose a higher maintenance burden.\r\n\r\nCognitive Complexity is already available as a new rule in some Sonar code analyzers, and should be available throughout the SonarQube ecosystem by the end of 2017.","notes":"30min Tech Talk\r\n\r\nSonarSource (the company behind [SonarQube](http://sonarqube.org)) is introducing a new way of measuring complexity: [Cognitive Complexity](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cognitive-complexity-because-testability-understandability/), which gives a far more accurate measurement of the relative understandability of a method than Cyclomatic Complexity. \r\n\r\nI'll cover these topics:\r\n* Cyclomatic Complexity: what it's good for and what's it's not, i.e. why a new standard/metric is needed\r\n* Cognitive Complexity: motivations, specifics, benefits\r\n* How to use Cognitive Complexity to guide refactoring.

I'm familiar with cyclomatic complexity, we use sonarqube in our organization, and we follow the \"automate all the things\" motto. I was reading the description and wondering if cognitive complexity could be something analyzable by sonarqube (or other static code analysis tool). When I read in the Description that in this talk I would learn a method to calculate a Cognitive Complexity score, then I imagined the worst: 'it's not automated yet.'  Only when I saw the notes I realized it's automated and, better yet, part of sonarqube. \r\nSo, my suggestion is to make clear in the Description that this approach is automated. I think you should also mention it will be part of the sonarqube ecosystem soon. \r\n\r\n- You may already be planning to, but I suggest clarifying whether cognitive complexity should replace or complement cyclomatic complexity analysis. In other words, in my quality index formula, should I use both, maybe with different weights?  \r\n\r\n- SATURN is focused on software architecture and different code analyses bring a lot of design insight. So, I also suggest drawing a connection between cognitive complexity and design quality. \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-18T02:47:12.638Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T02:47:12.638Z"},{"id":3401,"submission_id":7615,"talk_id":14500,"user":{"name":"G.

In particular, a dependable CPS responds correctly and timely even in situations where system parts have failed, either temporarily or permanently. This requirement also applies when tests check reliability, availability and performance properties of these systems in the lab and in the field. A CPS with test probes built-into all HW/SW-components throughout the CPS lifecycle can fulfill these requirements. Applied to an eCar, non-intrusive, deterministic fault-injection tests executed by test probes provide strong evidence for statements like: “While driving, the eCar can safely be steered when a fault fails a central, redundant HW/SW component that executes steering operations”.\r\n\r\nTests of such systems and properties pose various challenges, for example (1) stimulating selected CPS parts with correct data and with faulty data in rare and critical situations, (2) checking selected CPS parts at selected points in time, or during time intervals according to focused and measurable test goals, (3) differentiation of the CPS's treatment of temporary and permanent faults, and (4) absolute non-disturbance of the tested system's functionality or timing. The fourth challenge applies in particular to fault-injection tests that check CPS safety, or that operate near the border between the CPS and the physical process.\r\n\r\nMeeting the challenges outlined above requires that the architecture of the system under evaluation be designed for testability. Starting from here, we first characterize the CPS we use as an example: an integration platform of an X-by-wire eCar (www.projekt-race.de/en). This motivates the need for reliable statements on the real-time behavior of the system from different tests, from which we derive testability requirements. Afterwards, we elaborate a series of design tactics that enable or improve the system’s testability, focusing on test probes. A test probe is a kind of Built-in Monitor (SEI: Testability tactic) or Maintenance Interface (R. Hanmer: Patterns for fault-tolerant systems) with particular demands in probe environments. When these demands are fulfilled, test probes can execute deterministic, efficient and reliable real-time tests, or act as safety monitors that observe and potentially intervene in a system.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the system domain you will learn two key aspects: how to design a testable system that incorporates test probes as central system elements, and how to write non-intrusive tests that yield reliable results.","notes":"","abstract":"We discuss the practical use of novel HW/SW test probes to non-intrusively check functional, performance, and safety properties in fault-tolerant cyber-physical systems.

Some call it the age of digitalization. No matter what you call it, we are harvesting more and more data about people and businesses. This data is then connected to other data and exposed as services which needs to be protected properly. As software architects, our primary security goal is to write secure software. Secure software has a technical aspect that is well covered (if not understood) in developer literature, but there is also a human and organizational aspect of security we as software architects must manage.  These aspects often go beyond the boundaries of the software development organization and are influenced by forces well beyond the company walls.\r\n\r\nOn the path to security there are a lot of trade-offs to be made, and some of these are made outside the IT organization. After working for more than 20 years in large organizations, I have found that there are certain signals that can be used to identify if you have a weak security culture. They do not necessarily identify security problems in themselves, but are indicators of topics that merit further investigation.\r\n\r\n__In this talk I will cover topics such as:__\r\n\r\n- Balancing prevention, detection and response\r\n- Leadership\r\n- Balancing Short term gains vs long time security impact\r\n- Handling security incidents\r\n- The importance of the curious mind\r\n- Communicating security concerns beyond the IT organization\r\n","notes":"__Note: This talk was originally submitted as a 30 minute talk.

Working for more than 20 years in the IT industry, I have seen security fail in the most spectacular ways. For the past year, the company I work for (Statoil, a global oil and gas company) has seen an increased focus on IT security in the wake of internal and external events. I have been part of a task force addressing some of these issues, and although the particulars are confidential, there are still general learning that can be made. Some of these learnings are technical, but a lot of them are organizational and are valid across organizations large and small.

In the Description, you say there is also a human and organizational aspect of security we must manage. I find that a little vague. Could you give examples of human and organizational security aspects that architects need to manage?\r\n\r\n2. In the Description, you mention there are signals to identify a weak security culture. You could say explicitly that you will discuss these signals in the presentation--I sure hope that's the case.\r\n\r\n3. Consider adding what participants will learn, that is, how do they benefit from this talk. \r\n\r\n4. I suggest saying either \"As software architects, our primary security goal is to design secure software\"  or  \"As software developers, our primary security goal is to write secure software\"\r\n\r\n5. Since you mention the technical aspects of producing secure software, I'm not sure where does your presentation stand between the project-specific, technical aspects, and the more generic, organizational aspects.

What does the history of software architecture tell us about the challenges of this new environment? And how does our approach to software architecture need to evolve in order to meet them?\r\n\r\nSoftware architecture has been a mainstream discipline since the 1990s and in that time has become a recognised, widely researched and often valued part of the software engineering process. However architecture approaches must reflect the technologies and priorities of the systems we are building and in this regard its future has never looked more uncertain or more exciting. \r\n\r\nFrom our history of monolithic compile time architecture, to many tiered distributed systems, to Internet connected services, we are now entering the era of cloud-hosted, microservice-based, pay-for-usage systems development.

Based on the past 16 years of his life, there is no question about the genius of this kid; but not so much can be said about some of his entourage and followers. Missteps in his career threw shadows of doubt at times about his potential. However, as he matured and opened up to his parents’ wisdom and history, he’s been able to build a well-rounded experience that’s making him competitive for the next phase of his life.\r\n\r\nI wrote my first full-fledge program (app in today’s term) in the Spring of 2001, around the same time Mr. Agile moved into my neighborhood. I didn’t get to know him until early 2004 when his entourage grew into a dedicated community of fans and followers. Back then, I had one trusted mentor and an old friend, Mr. Architecture. Becoming friends with Mr. Agile was new and exciting but brought about challenges to my relationship with my old friend. Therefore, my growing up as a software professional was about learning how I could maintain friendships with both, reconciling their differences, and being better at what I do because of it.  \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I grow up in this kid’s world. So what does that look like? \r\n\r\nIn this DEV@SATURN talk, I’ll narrate the story about growing up as friends with Mr. Agile and Mr. Architecture. I don’t intend to indulge the “agile vs architecture” debate. On the contrary, I’ll annotate my story with examples from our journeys together, sharing experiences with some of Mr. Agile’s friends who advocated architecture sabotage, as well as situations where the outcomes were better because I had a foot in both camps and had won the internal struggle as to how to reconcile.\r\n\r\nCome join me in this talk as I’m sure you’ll find resemblances to your own journey. ","notes":"<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>\r\nThis talk is inspired by Linda Northrop’s keynote last year when she gestured a fist-bump to her chest, a sign of regret, about the stall/damage agile movement did to the progress of architecture adoption. It made me reflect on how I’ve lived the collision of these two worlds. \r\n\r\nAfter discussing an early version of this draft with her, I thought I should write and share my experience in the form of a TED@SATURN talk.\r\n\r\nMy starting thought was the fact that being close to agile movement from the beginning propelled my growth as a software professional, and my practice of software development have been better for it. However, this didn’t come without a struggle against an entourage littered with misunderstanding, incompetence, and lack of discipline.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, it’s clear that the agile pendulum swung too far in the beginning in a zeal to fix the ills of non-agile approaches. But like all physical pendulums, this one had to come back to equilibrium as agile original proponents began to realize that they overlooked some methodology-neutral principles key to developing quality software, including architectural principles.  \r\n\r\nThe punch line in this talk is that at this point agile is a reality. We are at a stage where we need to forgo the discussion about agile for agile sake OR architecture for architecture sake. We need to embrace this agile pendulum equilibrium in the making, and regain the role of those who think about appropriate practices, regardless of methodology, to build high quality software – Software that is fit for its intended use, where fitness has many dimensions beyond pure functionality. \r\n\r\nThe vehicle for me to deliver this is through storytelling based on my own software journey. I'll try to dig out old pictures to put in the background to color the scene.  \r\n\r\n<h1>TALK STRUCTURE (DRAFT)</h1>\r\nFor the purposes of this segment of SATURN, my talk will feature a storyline emphasizing a classic story ingredients.\r\n\r\n<h2>Origination</h2> \r\nYear 2001. \r\nA dozen or so smart software engineers with stellar backgrounds are holding a collective grudge against waterfall-like processes, titles, and roles. Like many revolutions, a manifesto is crafted in a mysteriously remote venue, and subsequently shared with the world: Baby agile is born. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, my induction into the world of software development occurs. A baby software developer is born. \r\n\r\nScene – we live in the same neighborhood. \r\n\r\n<h2>Building towards a crisis</h2> \r\nTime is going to flyby quickly here. \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In the ensuing 10 years, agile grows to garnish a movement that dominates all descending voices challenging it. It's cool; it’s the buzz; and it’s unstoppable.</li>\r\n<li>I meet Mr. Agile for the first time. I’m fascinated (anecdotal incidence here). I go running to my old friend, Mr. Architecture. He’s less fascinated. (I get to know why later). </li>\r\n<li>It turns out, architecture best practices (and a lot of common sense) are the colloquial baby that was thrown out with the bathwater. Architecture vs Agile debate begins to take place. </li>\r\n<li>This makes me extremely uncomfortable. I like both my old friend and my new friend but how can I hang out with them both?</li> \r\n<li>Affiliated agile revolutionaries weren't grounded as leaders in software engineering thereby resulting in a number of documented software atrocities. I witness some of these first hand in my neighborhood.</li>\r\n<li>Moment of truth: Agile is widely accepted but now the epiphany – It isn't the silver bullet after all. Adults in the neighborhood have been saying so all along but the wave was too noisy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Beginning of resolution</h2> \r\nIn the last five years, architectural thinking begins to permeate the conversation among agile leaders. Voices of reason, architecture and agile leaders together, have begun to take charge of the discourse again. They’re beginning to have serious conversations about the real software development challenges at hand with a common goal to build software in a way that is both flexible and sustainable.\r\n\r\nI’m getting really uncomfortable as I now get to go out and watch game with both my old and new friends. (Anecdotal incidence here). \r\n\r\nGreat headways are achieved but also challenges remain with a hopeful future – that of bringing our community together and embracing each other’s strengths.  \r\n\r\n<h2>Ending Monolog</h2>\r\nWhile I feel privileged to have grown up with this boy and met & learned from many of his clique, my work experiences led me to also work in many cases with the cronies. So I finish the story with a call to action for the audience to avoid the dichotomy of us versus them and to regain our role as the chaperons of quality as manifested in the end-products and artifacts regardless of the adopted software development methodology.  \r\n\r\nCurtain close. Audience cheers. Lights off. \r\n\r\n:)","abstract":"If Agile Manifesto were a boy, he'd be a high school junior today. Based on the past 16 years of his life, there's no question about his genius.

The role looks simple on paper: drive good, technical solutions to business problems. But with so much going on at any given moment and constant iteration, staying on top of and affecting outcomes across the board is practically impossible. If you can't even keep up, how can you find time to engage in the decision-making process?\r\n\r\nIn this environment, a 'command-and-control' style architect can encounter significant opposition and find themselves ineffective. Instead, we may consider exploring an entirely different approach. The Influential Architect is fusion of advisor, mentor, facilitator, communicator, and storyteller. As an Influential Architect, our aim is to improve outcomes across the organisation without the organisation becoming reliant on us making key decisions. To achieve this, we have to change the level of abstraction: where previously our purview has been decisions, we must now focus on people. When we can't be in every room where decisions are being made, we must affect the people who are and the process they use.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore what it means to be an Influential Architect, as well as some of the tools and techniques we can use to succeed. We'll cover:\r\n\r\n* Transparent Decision-making.\r\n    * How may we efficiently document and communicate our intentions with regards to technical solutions and what would those documents look like?\r\n    * How may we incorporate other development teams into our feedback cycle without creating bottlenecks?\r\n* The Light on the Hill.\r\n    * What is a technical vision and how does it help both the team and the wider organisation?\r\n    * How do we go about establishing a technical vision and who needs to be involved in this process?\r\n    * How do we hold teams accountable to technical visions, in order to ensure they work towards the same long-term goals?\r\n* Visual Storytelling.\r\n    * How can we effectively communicate technical outcomes to non-technical stakeholders?\r\n    * What are the key components of a good story and how does a story help communicate intentions?\r\n    * What does an example of a visual story that communicates a technical initiative look like?\r\n* Architectural Principles.\r\n    * What are architectural principles and why do we need them?\r\n    * How and in what format are architectural principles articulated?\r\n    * What does the process of establishing them look like to optimise for creating buy-in among technical teams?\r\n    * How may we hold teams accountable to the architectural principles we've established?\r\n* Sensible Defaults.\r\n    * How can we use sensible defaults to avoid reinventing the wheel while at the same time not hinder innovation?\r\n    * How do we go about establishing sensible defaults in an open and inclusive process?\r\n    * How do teams incorporate using sensible defaults in their work process?\r\n* Strategic Thinking.\r\n    * How can we champion long-term concerns in an iterative agile process?\r\n\r\nIn the longer version of the talk, we'll expand on the aforementioned tools by going through them in greater detail with several real-life examples, and also cover:\r\n\r\n* A case study of failures.\r\n    * What were the approaches that didn't work so well?\r\n    * Why did they fail and what can we learn from them?\r\n* Team suitability.\r\n    * Are there any _team_ characteristics that are necessary in order for an Influential Architect to be effective?\r\n    * What can we do to prepare teams for greater autonomy if they are not ready for it?\r\n* Architect suitability.\r\n    * Are there any _personal_ characteristics that significantly make this type of role easier to fulfil for the Influential Architect?\r\n* Evaluating outcomes.\r\n    * How do we measure our own success in influencing teams?\r\n    * How do we know which teams need more (or less) support than others?\r\n    * Under what circumstances might it be acceptable to stray from the technical vision?","notes":"This is probably best suited as a 30 minute talk, but can be expanded into a 90 minute talk if so desired. The presentation has no technical requirements other than a projector for the slides.\r\n\r\nMy presentations tend to be fun and engaging.

I gave a talk about Event Sourcing at last year's SATURN which was well received: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TeMYF_JjNg\r\n\r\nHaving lived and breathed the role of Influential Architect at Envato in Melbourne, Australia, I'm well-positioned to talk through the lessons I've learned throughout my journey.

Over 120 people are directly involved in the day-to-day development and delivery of software projects. As the only person with Software Architecture in my job title, I guide these teams and people to ensure that we are making sound technical descision and are all working towards the same technical vision.\r\n\r\nThe Influence approach we've been trialling at Envato has been very successful, with a transparent decision-making process and better outcomes. For the first time ever, we have a coherent long-term architectural vision that is understood and frequently referenced by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Teams are able to move faster, with the reassurance of knowing they are heading in the same direction as everyone else.\r\n\r\nI'm excited to share what I've learned about the role of a Software Architect at scale. The presentation is packed with advice on what's worked and what hasn't, and has concrete real-world examples rather than abstract ones. There should be interesting content for all types of architects even if they work in very different environments.","abstract":"In a company at scale with many fully autonomous and agile development teams, the architect's role is more about preventing entropy than it is setting direction.

The word “stream” implies a continuous process, but in real life that stream is far from homogeneous. Architects (or whoever else owns the design decisions) find themselves making decisions with widely varying impact, based on information with differing levels of uncertainty, throughout the life of a software solution. On top of that, the way these decisions and their impact are communicated evolves as the audience and the focus of the architectural communication change.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we explore the metaphor of a human lifetime to illustrate various aspects of architectural decision making, throughout a software solution’s life cycle. Amid all the fluidity of the stream of design decisions, we will look for anchor points with common concerns to address and recurring communication needs. We will see how the nature of architectural decisions changes when we go from birth (the first architectural outline) to graduation (making the business case), and find guidance on communicating the architecture at times of life-defining milestones like marriage (committing to the architecture) and revolutionary changes to the solution. The points will be illustrated by real-life examples from an interesting case study.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial is based on Risk- and Cost-Driven Architecture, a popular approach to improve architecture practices in both traditional and agile contexts, with the aim of providing “just enough anticipation” in the architecture. No prior knowledge of RCDA is required to attend.","notes":"This is a 90-minute tutorial.\r\n\r\nDuring the product lifecycle, key aspects of architectural decisions change, depending on the life stage:\r\n\r\n* level of risk and cost control: the cone of uncertainty\r\n* available information to base architectural decisions on\r\n* impact of architectural decisions\r\n* number of architectural decisions\r\n* cost of change to the architecture\r\n\r\nCertain milestones like graduation (approving the business case for the solution) and marriage (the moment after which it becomes very expensive to change the architecture) occur in every solution life cycle. Such milesones lead to standard stakeholder concerns, like affordability, level of risk control and predictability. We use the commonality of these concerns to provide the architect with standard views in their documentation, enabling them to show how the architecture addresses these common concerns.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n1.

However his hypothesis became known as Conway’s law and many organizations can say that they have observed the same behaviors as outlined in Melvin’s original paper. \r\n\r\nHere at IBM Watson, we just completed an initial release of a new microservice-based cloud platform. This service involved multiple teams, multiple microservices and multiple timezones.  We took a cloud product from inception on a lightening fast roller coaster ride to GA in five months, and lived to tell the story. We didn’t get everything right, but we learned alot along the way and we’d like to share those learnings. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will share our experience, and talk about some of the architectural successes and mistakes we made. We’ll talk about how we used Conway’s law, and the inverse Conway manuever to correct some of those mistakes. We’ll also touch on some of the issues confronting our teams with remote team members and how we solved them. We’ll provide a prescription for approaching team architecture based on our learnings. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the presentation, attendees will gained a knowledge of Conway’s law, how to use it to their advantage, and how to take an architecture led focus for team creation and development. \r\n\r\n","notes":"This will be a slide-based presentation with the following tentative outline:\r\n\r\n* Problem statement: Architecting teams is hard to get right the first time.

What do you mean by \"a cloud product\"? A software product that runs on the cloud? Is the cloud product the cloud platform that you mention in the previous sentence? In any case, can you say more about the nature of the software product?  \r\n\r\n2. If I understood correctly, this talk focuses on the architecture of the *team*, not the software architecture. It talks about team creation, team architecture. Conway's law is indeed about the organizational structure. That's fine! But you say the product is microservice-based. I think microservices are not only independent deployment and runtime elements, but they enable independent, smaller teams. Microservice teams are hence easier to put together and manage. Following this line of thought, we would need more guidelines and wisdom about how to create a team for monolithic applications.  :^)\r\n\r\n3.

Know the difference between Newtonian-style abstractions and Aristotelian-style abstractions. Aristotelian abstractions are built up piecemeal and are full of corner cases, like Aristotelian physics. Newtonian abstractions are elegant, formal, and composable.\r\n\r\n2. Follow a design process for developing an algebraic abstraction that can compose and easily express solutions (Newtonian style). Building data transformation pipelines is the step most people who are learning functional programming get to from reading and experimenting. Building algebraic abstractions is the next step, but there isn't much literature on the topic (outside of academia)\r\n    1. Elaborate a physical metaphor\r\n    2. Describe the meaning of your metaphor as mathematical statements\r\n    3. Construct the meaning using constructs from the language\r\n    4. Implement the abstraction by refactoring the meaning\r\n\t\r\n\tThe physical metaphor is an important first step that gives us an anchor from which we may use our intuition. We then query our metaphor for its properties and write them in math, which usually means types and equations. After that, we can construct a runnable version of the meaning, being careful to build it out of parts constrained by our statements from step 2. Finally, the implementation becomes an easy matter of refactoring our runnable version.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis topic idea comes from my experience teaching functional programming to people with all levels of experience. There seems to be a logical progression of insights that people go through as they learn about functional programming. I don't see many people getting past the \"data transformation\" step, so I want to present something further. It's hard to say whether it's THE next step, but it is at least one step beyond transformations.\r\n\r\nA lot of the thinking comes from my experience as a professional Clojure and Haskell programmer and the work of Conal Elliott, John Hughes, and Gerald Sussman.\r\n\r\nI have given a version of this talk at Clojure/conj 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJIUoaIvD20 I would love to adapt this to a language like JavaScript.

Scale is unclear - is this more of a programming-in-the-large or small approach or is it applicable at all scales? Is there evidence that the resulting abstractions are robust in practice?

If you create an architecture that doesn’t give value to the customer you are wasting your time. When I talk to customers I often hear horror stories about how their current systems were developed by someone in an ivory tower who didn’t understand them or their work. So how do you make sure that you are bringing value to the customer through your architecture? Use customer centric design processes often called Contextual Design or Design Thinking. These are fundamental parts of Lean and Agile and this session shows how to use them in architecture with hands on experience. In this highly interactive session participants redesign a system by interviewing a customer, creating a prototype, reviewing it with the group, and getting feedback on their design. Using the methods taught in this class you can create value for your customer through your architecture and become their hero, or at least not the person in the ivory tower who is ruining their life.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nParticipants will learn basic methods of contextual design and design thinking and how they apply to the architecture of a software system\r\nParticipants will learn customer interviewing techniques to gain knowledge of the customer's functional and non-functional requirements\r\nParticipants will learn creating prototypes of their architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to give constructive feedback on an architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to receive constructive feedback on an architecture","notes":"My goal for this session is to help architects learn a customer centric design process. I learned this method from the \"Deciding what to Design\" course at Carnegie Mellon. The method is often called Contextual Design or Design Thinking. Its a fundamental part of Lean and Agile. I've rarely seen people show how these methodologies apply to architecture, so thats my goal for class.\r\n\r\nI use this process in my own work at GE and previously at Verizon.  I lead the End to End Customer Experience efforts at Verizon and enabled our architects and software engineers to talk to customers. I gave a talk on that experience at a past SATURN that generated a lot of interest.\r\n\r\nAt GE I am using this method to design a new CI/CD system for our Industrial Internet of Things platform called Predix. Customers (anyone who gets value from the system you are creating) really appreciate working with me. I find out very surprising things by using this method and create much better systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nA slightly modified version of this session has been given before at Code on The Beach and was well received.  I used the \"App for adding contact to network\" use case and it ended up being a common but complex enough task that the groups had plenty to design. The Code on the Beach session was 60 minutes long and I assigned roles to each team member. I didn’t have time to have feedback given to each group, but I think it is an effective way to leverage the knowledge in the room. I didn’t have time to fit in the last wrap up session either, which I think is critical for people to concrete the new information. I've added those two parts to this 90 minute session.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nParticipants will learn basic methods of contextual design and design thinking and how they apply to the architecture of a software system\r\nParticipants will learn customer interviewing techniques to gain knowledge of the customer's functional and non-functional requirements\r\nParticipants will learn creating prototypes of their architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to give constructive feedback on an architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to receive constructive feedback on an architecture\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participatory session will include the following:\r\n15 minutes\r\nIntroduction to Customer Experience Design\r\nIntroduce the hands on Exercise: Design a new system for adding a contact to your network (Linkedin, google+ , etc.)\r\nDivide session into groups of 4 or 5 people.\r\n\r\n10 minutes\r\nActivity 1: Determine what matters to the customer including their functional requirements and quality attributes by watching how they do the task in their natural environment and asking lots of “why’s”. I will ask each group to select someone in their group to be the \"customer.\" Each group will watch their customer collect a business card from a person and add a contact to their network of choice.\r\n\r\n25 minutes \r\nActivity 2: Design the system around the customer’s needs and document it in a prototype. The prototype should be as interactive as possible, not just a flow chart. Prototype should show the architecture elements. Because the “customer” is involved, the team should be constantly getting input from the customer on their on going design. They should also write down any assumptions they are making and any reasons they made design decisions. Finalize the prototype, the assumptions, design decisions, and what they learned from the process.\r\n\r\n30 minutes \r\nActivity 3: Review the prototype with the group. Receive feedback on design. About 5 minutes each group.\r\n\r\n5 minutes\r\nWrap up: Allow the small groups to meet one last time to discuss the feedback and make any changes to their design.\r\n\r\n10 minutes\r\nFinal Group discussion: Discuss what they learned from the session. Find out what they learned from receiving and giving feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","abstract":"Have you heard stories about how systems were designed in an ivory tower by someone who didn’t understand the customer or their goal?

Depending on time, we may get into testing, deployment, and other advanced topics.\r\n\r\nIn what situations would you recommend someone not adopt server-less architectures?\r\n-  The biggest benefits for serverless are 1) decreased complexity for developers - abstracting away  server-level administration and devOps tasks and 2) lower costs for applications on VMs that spend time idling.  So, for those that have a mature, stable, and effective devOps infrastructure that already abstracts server complexity from developers and for those whose VMs don't have much idle computing time, transitioning to serverless probably isn't going to be cost/risk-effective.  \r\n\r\n- There may be other reasons to not transition: risk aversion (\"this is too new and unproven\"), compliance (\"we neither own the data center NOR manage any of the VM infrastructure??\"), or simple mistrust (\"how do I know it's going to scale when I really need it to?\") It's important that application architects take into consideration their corporate policies, compliance and risk requirements, and organizational change tolerance when considering serverless.","created_at":"2016-12-19T19:19:47.874Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T19:19:47.874Z"},{"id":2928,"submission_id":7119,"talk_id":13610,"user":{"name":"David Aktary","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/5152/2013_THR_David_Headshot.jpg","email":"aktaryda@gmail.com"},"body":"Apologies for the odd message formatting above...

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. The term serverless is actually quite broad and poorly defined. For example, [Mike Roberts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) associates serverless to the use of MBaaS (more common), or alternatively richer clients (SPA?) talking to services behind an API gateway. Your talk probably has a clear description of what a serverless architecture is to you, but I'm thinking a brief definition in the talk description itself would also be helpful to correctly set the expectations of participants looking at the conference program.\r\n\r\n2. Assuming this is a 90-minute participatory session, the talk description (visible to conference participants) at some point has to clearly state this is a hands-on session and attendees should have a github and AWS account, and bring their laptops.\r\n\r\n3. The description could also be explicit about what frameworks, languages, and technologies will be used in the hands-on.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T16:37:10.485Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T16:37:10.485Z"},{"id":3844,"submission_id":7119,"talk_id":13610,"user":{"name":"David Aktary","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/5152/2013_THR_David_Headshot.jpg","email":"aktaryda@gmail.com"},"body":"Thank you for your feedback, Paulo!

Please find some of my responses.\r\n\r\n1.\tIn the Talk Description, why is transformation capitalized in SOA Transformation? In particular, this phrase is not clear and somewhat intriguing: \"the Software Transformation journey we should have in a fast-moving environment, where the agility is the key\". Maybe there's more objective motivation for the specific transformations you will describe.\r\n\r\nMost of the organizations which grow very fast tend to first focus on getting things done quickly and later worry about getting things done in the perfect fashion. This kind of accustoms business stakeholders used to seeing quick results. It takes some time to realize the importance of SOA, standardization, governance. When an organization attempts to do a Transformation Journey replacing the majority of the monolithic code base with industry standard COTS/SAAS/Systems/Custom Built Systems, coupled with the transition to SOA there is still a level of impatience to see quick results. Also, there is an expectation that buying SAAS/COTS products means they would start working immediately. These misconceptions posed significant challenges for us to keep providing continuous Business Value as well as working towards accomplishing embracing SOA. So, on one hand, we were doing a major re-haul of our systems and on another hand also making sure that we embrace SOA as well as providing incremental business value. We accomplished SOA not in isolation but by coupling tangible business benefits spread over a period of time also delivering incrementally. Those are the details I would like to share and that’s the reason why I would like to call it an SOA Transformation. \r\n\r\n2.\tI think most of the material out there is settling to using microservices as opposed to micro-services.\r\nI’ll have this corrected. Thank you!\r\n\r\n3.\tIf you find that your talk is too long, I suggest removing the first topic (\"Rackspace - Business and System Perspective\").\r\nPlease see point 4.\r\n\r\n4.\tI think the description is somewhat vague, especially for a 90-minute session. If it's 90 minutes long, it takes the time equivalent to 3 30-minute talks, so the info should be clearly valuable. You mention a case study. Maybe you should say more about the case study.\r\n\r\nThe introduction around Rackspace - Business and System Perspective is supposed to say more about the case study. Based on the time that is allotted, I would get this condensed accordingly. I would ideally prefer 60 minutes. 90 minutes seems to be a stretch.\r\n\r\n5.\tThings you could add to the description to make it more interesting: what technology transformation will you talk about? If it's monolithic to microservices, what do your monoliths looked like? Java EAR apps? MS .NET? Where do you run your microservices? Docker? Kubernetes? What tools and frameworks did you add to your runtime environment, development environment, continuous integration/deployment environment?\r\n\r\nSure I would add more details. The presentation is more around how we introduced SOA, embraced a culture of SOA and the difficulties we faced in the transformation. We had a couple of huge monoliths built mainly using Python/Java and they had undergone many revisions. The processes that we had were initially divergent and people dependent. From there we moved towards SOA, standardization of technology, deployment processes, CI and partly CD, and we could add details around the exact technology selection and standardization process we have also including details about Docker and other technologies we use. The challenges that would be described would be more on the lines of the phased steps we took to provide incremental business value and to reduce risks which helped as accomplish a major transformation. This an ongoing journey and we would talk about how we are beginning to embrace Microservices.\r\n\r\n6.\tI think the most challenging aspect of the monolith-to-microservice transition is finding the appropriate functional scope for the microservices. If they are too small, you may end up with chatty communications and lower autonomy and performance. If a microservice encompasses functional contexts that is too large, you move closer to the monolithic model and may not significantly realize the microservices benefits. What approaches have you used to help define the size of microservices? Did DDD help?\r\n\r\nGreat point, As an enterprise organization, we have not gone into a spree of replacing everything into MicroService. We are finding right use cases where we really could provide value out of carving Micro Services or introducing new MicroServices. I plan to present a case study of one such real use case and the practical benefits we gained from it. We have applied DDD concepts like Bounded Context and also to further split into Sub Contexts to select MicroService Candidates which helps in defining an appropriate logical boundary. We have also beginning to introduce Micro FrontEnds. Also during our SOA Transformation, we had already begun to apply many of the MicroService Principles even though the term hasn’t become popular. We would also provide those details.\r\n\r\n7.\tWhat communication mechanisms did you use in microservices (what connector types)? Http (REST)? WebSocket? Asynchronous messages/events?\r\n\r\nWe have standardized on HTTP/REST. We had also build our own Messaging Infra Structure using REST: Atom Hopper. ATOM was used as the Messaging Standard across the Services. However within the Bounded Context Teams were free to pick appropriate messaging platforms.\r\n\r\n8.\tI think \"methods of how to accomplish large-scale technology transformations\" is quite ambitious. If you don't have exactly methods, but guidelines or best practices derived from experience, that's ok too.\r\nSure I would rephrase as per your suggestion.

","description":"The software architect is the lone carrier of DNA for the vision of the product, but does not work alone. He/she is placed on a project (“situation”) where he/she must still deliver. The big band drummer can single handedly guide a band, and is placed on a gig (“situation”) where he/she must deliver. What is at the core of the big band drummer’s DNA to bring about success and what parallels might we draw between the two? Come and find out.\r\n\r\nSometimes the most efficient way to a fresh perspective is to sit in the seat of someone else from a totally unrelated field. Reading Harvard Business Review, competitive companies seek advice from totally unrelated fields to solve their most difficult problems. So why should it be any different for software architect?  The software architect’s role in leading teams and influencing business decisions cannot be overlooked. \r\n\r\nJohn Ryskowski would love to reveal the big band drummer’s strategy for success and its attendant parallels to the software architect’s “situation.”  Of course, band stories and drumming demonstrations will be included.\r\n","notes":"Session Requirements:\r\n1) To start a conversation that will last throughout the rest of the conference. \r\n2) To obtain a “fresh perspective” by taking folks down the path of a totally unrelated field and drawing pertinent parallels for and with them. \r\n3) As an architect one must create and nurture the vision for the DNA of the product, in spite of the project situation. The big band drummer must nurture a good sound from the big band, in spite of the gig situation. The parallels between the two should be realized, discussed, and brought to grounded historical experiences for each attendee. \r\n4) To introduce some new language that may help put project situations into perspective allowing one to return to clarity of thought. Psychologically speaking we get some relief from having name for some events or techniques. For example, I need to vary my intensity to get the group affect that I desire.\r\n\r\nThe session breakdown:\r\nHandouts: The actual drum chart for the subject of the talk- Kubis’ arrangement of “A Train,” and the “Clapping at Camp” chart written for audience participation. Big sticky papers will be on the walls of the room. \r\n\r\n1) Explain how one path to a fresh perspective is to experience something that is totally unrelated, but at the same time reveals grounded parallels to your situation. Executing a big band chart requires a strategy with known techniques but the flexibility to grab opportunities to inspire and transcend the moment. Through subtle and timely queues, the drummer can instill a sense of confidence and inspire the band to play better than they imagined. The techniques we discuss could have the same effect for the people on the architect’s project.\r\n2) Through demonstration, we discuss some of the possible variations the drum set can offer. This would include the elements of the drum set with each of their different sounds, the 4 limbs of the body, and just some of the combinations thereof. We will stick with the combinations that are most pertinent for this talk, and don’t forget the eyes and brain play a role as well. \r\n3) We get into a discussion about some of the situations the big band drummer must deal with. Does the band leader know little about music (or does the manager of the program or product owner know little about the technology)?  Does the lead trumpet think he is with the Count Bassie band (or is your development principle unaccustomed to this environment)? Can the bass player not play in time (or does your development principle have no sense of time)? Is the drum set in the absolute worst location to work with the rest of the band (or are you stuck without a reasonable means of communication with the rest of the team)? I will demonstrate how the big band drummer overcomes each of these situations. \r\nI then ask each member of the audience to choose which situation they resonate with most. Audience members will then join 1 of 4 groups to discuss their personal situations, their solutions or possible solutions then elect the top 3 solutions to brief the rest of the other groups. \r\n4) Two vital techniques in big band drumming are then discussed: “Distinguishing signal from noise” knowing the current location of the chart without listening to anyone’s sense of time, and “Some of your great ideas may not be so great.” The audience will then be asked to verbalize their own parallels, and If the interest and energy are present, we can briefly split into two groups, discuss and brief.\r\n5) The “Kubis” chart is then projected on the screen and actually played on the drum set asking the audience to try and observe, as best they can, all that is going on with the drum set performance. We then deconstruct each element of successful drum chart execution. Each element and a lesson to take away:\r\na) Element- Initiating and maintaining a tempo for the band. Lesson- What is least exciting for you may be most important to them.  You set the tone for what is to come and instill a sense of calm. Sometimes you’re just a piece of leverage. Wow that last one hurt.\r\nb) Element- Identify milestones. Lesson- Marking points in time to celebrate progress, ensure social/technical alignment, and instill confidence.\r\nc) Element- Vary intensity as needed. Lesson- Selectively applying energy at the right times and in the right places, balancing support, teaching, and inspiration.\r\nd) Element- Special care. Lesson- Sometimes hand-holding is necessary.\r\ne) Element- Set them up for success. Lesson- Anytime you set someone up for success, they feel good and want to work with you. \r\nThe audience is once again, asked to choose which of these they resonate with most. Audience members will then join 1 of 5 groups and discuss their personal situations (or parallels) amongst their group. Each group will then brief the other groups. \r\n6) The “Clapping at Camp” chart is introduced. I show how without even being able to read music (or a rhythm chart) I can still set them up for success. We rehearse the sections of the chart. Then we perform the chart together and they clap in time like they were born to do it. It’s really fun.\r\n\r\nPresentation History\r\nThis topic has been presented at Agile West, Las Vegas, 2016. \r\nSummary score of 8.69. Total attendees 45. Total of 4 written comments here verbatim:\r\n1- Fun! Fun! Fun! Perspective and musical metaphor\r\n2- Novel application and most engaging session by far! \r\n3- Very unique, engaging, and appropriate. One of my favorite presentations and many parallels were illustrated.\r\n4- Content was delivered in a muddled way. Good points were buried in musician stories and metaphors.\r\n\r\nReferences to Speaking Ability\r\nI like to pull people out of their everyday situations, immerse them into something completely different that is fun and interesting, then help them to draw parallels back to their everyday situations. This is an efficient path to a fresh perspective, which is the most valuable take-away from any conference.  \r\nThe ideal reaction cycle I strive for is: a) I wonder what that would be like, b) cool I didn’t know that, c) whoa I need to try this out. \r\nI have spoken at Agile West, CMMI Institute Conferences, Pacific Norhwest Software Quality Conference, National Defense Industrial Association. I have also delivered good and bad news to leaders of many corporations. \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\nKerry Trujillo,  Kerry_Trujillo@raytheon.com, see linkedIn recommendation\r\nMichael West, michael@naturalspi.com\r\n","abstract":"How does the architect ensure a great product, in spite of, well, the situation at hand?

I’m curious if any parallels to architect or architecture surfaced during your presentation at that venue. This proposal fits Topic 3, “The software architect’s role in leading teams and influencing business decisions” in the call for presentations. There are different ways to approach this, with perspectives on people, process, or product. It is not necessary to cover all perspectives though I’d like to better understand where you will probe for parallels. Do you think the product (software architecture) will be a point of discussion or will it be more about stories of people and process?\r\n\r\nYour notes provide a good sense of the topics covered and the flow through the session.

The group participation discussed in steps 3, 5, and possibly step 4, in the SATURN proposal are an addition to this version of the talk. These group exercises will allow for a richer processing experience for the folks than what happened at AW. All this added up gives me about 35 minutes for 2 or 3 group participation exercises which should be no problem. This is general time estimate, if specific time allocations are required I would be happy to add them.  Additionally, in this limited time, at AW no parallels to architect came up at AW.\r\n\r\nAs for being under topic 3, I am happy to go with that. People, process, or product- the parallels will focus mostly on people. People are the common point between BB drumming and architects. But to be honest with you, I am not sure where these group exercises will go. One of the verbal comments after my talk at AW was that I did not presuppose to know the parallels exactly, and left space for attendees to formulate their own. It is the opening of this space that is my objective, less so giving a direct answer.   \r\n\r\nFrom you- The breakdown into element and lesson gives a sense of the parallels between drummer and leadership (in general). Would you say more about the points you will make about how these relate more specifically to the architect’s “situation”. \r\n\r\nResponse- From the 5000 foot perspective, the BB Drummer and architect have the same challenge. Take responsibility for the vision and integrity of the product without being given any authority or owning any of the resources. From lower altitude I am happy to make some adjustments though I do worry about anchoring, or disrupting where participants can go with their parallels. How do you feel about the “additions” below?\r\n\r\n5a) Element- Initiating and maintaining a tempo for the band. Lesson- What is least exciting for you may be most important to them.  You set the tone for what is to come and instill a sense of calm. Sometimes you’re just a piece of leverage. Wow that last one hurt. Addition- While trying to balance creativity, risk, stakeholders and the responsibility to change the world, it is good to have a basic rhythm that all can operate to. \r\n\r\n5b) Element- Identify milestones. Lesson- Marking points in time to celebrate progress, ensure social/technical alignment, and instill confidence. Addition-  Is there a build and release rhythm you can work to?\r\n\r\n5c) Element- Vary intensity as needed. Lesson- Selectively applying energy at the right times and in the right places, balancing support, teaching, and inspiration. Addition- The creative process comes down to a give and take in real time. You must dabble in interactions with people in the “known” before you can step over to the “unknown.”\r\n\r\n5d) Element- Special care. Lesson- Sometimes hand-holding is necessary. Addition- Sometimes you don’t have to blow up the village in order to save it. Education and patience can pay off. \r\n\r\n5e) Element- Set them up for success. Lesson- Anytime you set someone up for success, they feel good and want to work with you. Addition- Introduce people to the patterns that you see with grace and composure to assure overall success. \r\n\r\nBest- John \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T01:50:50.787Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T01:50:50.787Z"}]}},{"id":7570,"submission":{"id":7570,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-04T21:49:36.945Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T18:27:19.889Z","additional_info":"https://backend4android.github.io/","rating":1.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["unexpected behaviour","fun","c++","30 or 90-minute tech talk"],"profile":{"name":"Antonio Mallia","bio":"","twitter":"antonio_mallia","company":"Bloomberg LP","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniomallia","shirt_size":"Men's M","email":"mallia.antonio@gmail.com","location":"Unknown"},"talk":{"title":"C++: unexpected behaviour","description":"Do you really think to know C++?

Yes, the process here is we'll share some feedback you can use to update your submission or clarify with the tech committee, then next week we'll look at all the submissions and finalize the program taking into account the strength of the proposals but also make sure we have a good breadth and depth of relevant topics.\r\n\r\nHere are a few thoughts for your consideration.  This looks like good technical content and a nice, tight focus, but I worry that the primary SATURN audience will find this too low level.  If you are able to make a clearer connection from C++ corner cases and language \"oddities\" to broad systemic properties such as maintainability, performance, testability, etc. then I think the proposed talk could be a better fit for the audience.\r\n\r\nWe certainly cover technology and programming languages at SATURN, but the emphasis is on architectural design.  Perusing some past presentations might give you a better feel for the types of topics and level of detail https://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2016/\r\n\r\nThis proposal could also be made stronger by providing a bit more detail, especially for a 90 minute talk.

The double proposals leave it up to us to judge what is the best way to get your message across, which may or may not work in your benefit.\r\n\r\nI like the building a team aspect of your talk, architects often double as leads in one way or another, with or without reporting line responsibility.

We usually see some (lead) developers at SATURN, but please clarify whom your presentation will work for or how it will work for different groups.\r\n\r\nYour outline confuses as it is up-high (team-building) and down in the details (hands-on penetration testing).

The presentation is not hands on, where as the workshop is. Many people find that they learn better if they actually play with the tools. Playing with the tools is what happens in This workshop. The workshop will work well if we can get the VM I have to attendees before the workshop. Attendees need to have this setup and runable before the workshop, otherwise it usually takes up to much time during the workshop. If we can get a network share setup that attendees can download the VM, and follow the directions I provide before the workshop then it usually works well. Also having a box of NTFS formatted 16GB USB sticks loaded with my VM, that can be handed out on and/or during the conference or even in the workshop, has worked well as a backup plan.\r\n\r\nThis submission can also be run as a tutorial, which takes less time, due to the non hands on nature, no one has to set anything up other than myself. If run as a tutorial, I just run through the tooling parts as a workshop myself. This way attendees get more of an idea how things fit together than they would if it was just the short presentation.\r\n\r\nNumbers also play a part in what works best. If a large number of people wish to attend, then the presentation works best. If over 20 - 30 developers attend, then usually the workshop turns into more of a tutorial, unless, we are really organised and attendees are fully setup before the tutorial/workshop. I have 4 USB  sticks that I can pass around during the workshop, but this only works if there are 20 or less developers in the class.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, the workshop offers the most, but only if you can support the facilities required and both of us provide excellent comms to people wishing to attend the workshop in the weeks and days leading up to it. My preference is the presentation, as it is less work, but it's your call, I'm happy to run either.\r\n\r\nI have run quite a few training's similar to this before:\r\n\r\nNodeConfEU (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#security-regression-testing-with-zapapi-and-nodegoat-nodeconf-eu) was a similar workshop (45 people in the class), that may have ended up more of a tutorial, but didn't as we had a box of USB sticks loaded and a network share and had good comms with the attendees before the session.\r\n\r\nDevSecCon (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#devseccon-asia-2017-developing-a-high-performance-security-focussed-agile-team-2-hour-workshop) is aiming to host a similar workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, developers/engineers generally get a lot out of this. For me, I generally try not to differentiate to much between devs and architects. An excellent architect should still have their hands on the tools, it's just that they are also expected to be in a lot of other places at the same time. For the architects with less hands on involvement, the tutorial or even presentation style may be best suited to them. In saying that though, if everyone is setup before the workshop, then I can usually hold hands fairly firmly through the hands on content.\r\n\r\nThe content, whether hands on or not, in many cases is quite eye opening, so there are good take aways for all. My last presentation at AgileNZ (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#agilenz2016-agile-security-for-web-developers-50-minute-presentation) which was mostly targeted toward developers, was still well received by the audience which were mostly Product Owners, Managers and Architects. The AgileNZ presentation had quite a bit of the same content as what I've submitted here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high and low level together is what my book series addresses and encourages development teams (PO's, Managers, Architects, Engineers) to grasp and understand. First chapter being 30'000 foot view, which leads into 10,000 foot view, then into some fairly detailed asset identification, risk identification, countermeasure identification, etc... based on Bruce Schneier's Sensible Securitty Model (SSM). The content teaches all people involved in the process of building technical solutions to think outside of their tunnel vision. Architects to think about low level details and Engineers to think holistically, hence the title: \"Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developer\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by clear value proposition? Does the following not provide this:\r\n\"have proven their value in:\r\n(1) Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market)\r\n(2) Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs)\r\n(3) Without descoping\r\nand all while reducing total project cost (fact)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be happy for some assistance to formulate this better for SATURN if you would be keen to help?\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that has clarified most of it?\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z"},{"id":3622,"submission_id":8056,"talk_id":15299,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Kim, thank you for the clarification!

Reading your proposal this looks like a good survey of many topics with an emphasis on getting your software system \"production ready.\"  As a topic I think this is probably appropriate as long as the context is well established.  Reading your proposal I'm not sure what you mean by \"global jungle\" and whether the systems I work on would apply or not.  What is the context for the systems you are discussing?

This is not altogether different for how small startups often stumble or fail when they try to transition to the big leagues.  As far as context goes, I think this applies to any web, desktop or mobile system (internal to an organization or used by the public) that is intended to be used by individuals in multiple countries across the globe.  In particular if you are dealing with private or sensitive data.  When I refer to the “global jungle” I am talking about the multitude of things that you often don’t think or worry about when you \"first build\" your solution for your \"first user base\", but can be a catastrophic problem when you try to transition to a new region or the globe (and forces you back to the drawing board or worse yet becomes a fatal flaw and threatens your overall business model).  What do you feel is the best way to clarify the context due to its broad nature? <br><br>\r\nHow Deep? <br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nMy goal in this session is not to attempt to make anyone an expert in any given area.  Instead I want to give them an awakening so that they walk away with a new found appreciation that there are a bunch of other things they should spend some critical time on; since by spending it now it may very well either save their project from an unanticipated problem or differentiate them since their competitors failed to consider them.  Think back to when you first heard the horror stories around security and that had a lasting impact on your belief that it is something that shouldn’t be ignored.  I want to try to do the same for many other aspects that few people take seriously until it’s too late. <br><br>\r\nADVICE/TAILORING? <br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThis listing is what I have cultivated over the years and have used successfully to make both large and small systems “globally ready” and successful for the largest business unit of a 36.8 billion dollar company (for both internet and internal facing solutions).  The last few parts 7, 8, 9 are where I would try to give them some structured advice on how to balance all of these considerations so that they can prioritize and mitigate the risks while still having rapid agility in \"their jungle\". <br>\r\nThoughts?

The insights to be gained from data are endless. In light of this a new paradigm of the real-time communication between things has emerged, in which the quality of life of citizens in dense urban environments is increased through the security of using big data and cloud technology. Future cities are likely to feature thousands of strategically placed sensors that would record everything from air pressure and temperature to microbial content, and the data would be relayed instantly to the smart devices of actively participating citizens, who will make critical contributions to urban planning, reducing pollution, and making the best use of finite resources.\r\nThe proposed solution is the mobile connectivity that provides the network coverage wherever devices may roam. Secure cellular connection together with SIM cards and endpoints can be easily managed in real-time via the intuitive user-interface or directly from the customer’s software application via an easy-to-integrate API. Key features, development and implementation stages, as well as use cases will be discussed.  \r\nThe talk includes a lot of real working IoT use cases and their potential impact on our daily life.

These IoT devices can certainly connect through a lot of different ways, but in this talk we will focus on cellular connectivity.  \r\nObviously, other receptions are always limited to the access point, and also dependent on network and device configurations. Cellular has reception everywhere without any maintenance effort from the customer side, so with telecom access a large-scale investigation is possible. Given the ubiquity of sim based devices, cellular solutions can achieve an unbelievable level of coverage in both space and time for observing any events.\r\nIf we take IoT and wanna use it in a large scale for example in agriculture industry in Africa, we have to built a large suitable, secure and cost-efficient architecture/system. As low-energy network does not exist there and can provide connectivity only on one site, so the communication with the combine on the field will be always insecure.\r\nEven SMS can play a role as an intermediate solution and help with device distribution or middleware as GSM network always can be used, even if internet is not available, which makes it reliable and persistent channel for IoT connectivity.\r\nThis talk is more focused on use cases with real-time or time-critical services, of course it can impact economic and security.\r\n\r\nSnowy regards from Germany, \r\nKarina","created_at":"2017-01-31T14:44:57.109Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T14:44:57.109Z"}]}},{"id":8010,"submission":{"id":8010,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-13T18:34:46.858Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T18:27:20.251Z","additional_info":"N/A, I was speaking at the last Saturn conference in San Diego","rating":10.8,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":[],"profile":{"name":"Alexander von Zitzewitz","bio":"Alexander von Zitzewitz is founder, managing director of the company and CEO of the US subsidiary.

Business leaders who rely on information to make complex decisions in real time could not succeed as desired because technology could not cope up with their needs till today. This decades’ long wait has finally come to an end thanks to Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Analytics. Especially Real Time Analytics powered by In-Memory Computing (IMC) offers a way out from this rut. Further still, a truly disruptive hybrid model that shrewdly mixes both, “Relying on the past to predict the future” and “Real Time Analytics” is a fool proof approach for digital era analytics solutions. \r\n \r\nBy embedding a select array of Artificial Intelligence techniques from cognitive research arena right into the core algorithms and using state of the art research projects such as SRI, CNTK and Google Tensor Flow, how we can leverage In Memory Computing to address predictive business analytics issues will be addressed in this session.\r\n\r\nHow to address complex and strategic decision needs in real time?\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nBy flexing and blending a variety of technologies within the realm of In Memory Computing, we can address all the three types of decisions, including Operational, Tactical and Strategic. While operational and tactical decisions tap into existing datamarts and datastores which house transactional, structured data, strategic decision making goes beyond the traditional stores and rely heavily on real time, unstructured data influx. \r\n\r\nReal time strategic decision making in digital era is impossible unless we shatter today’s speed and scale barriers. For speed, we can leverage In Memory Computing that tackles both latent and live streams of data. For planet scale, as the volume is huge and expected to grow exponentially, an on-demand, scalable infrastructure should be erected to contain the catastrophes. As strategic decisions need to factor in various parameters, an ensemble of machine-learning algorithms are employed to crunch data, to classify the outliers and recommend meaningful actions to deal with a specific problem at hand. An enormous number of simulations, trained models and tests are applied to the data which has been acquired and prepared before passed on to the intelligent analytics engine to arrive at precise real-time business decisions.\r\n\r\nApplied IMC Use case - Customer Intimacy \r\n==================================\r\n\r\nAs the world is becoming more complex by the moment, strategic decision making in real time is also becoming extremely difficult and is compounded by the speed and scale with which information is generated and consumed. IMC furthers the decision-making process by employing cutting-edge tools, and conceiving and deploying disruptive models to address customer concerns. When it comes to meaningful engagement with customers, relying on heuristics and instinctive impulses for strategic making is no longer reliable, in today’s rapidly changing digital landscape.\r\n\r\nThis session is designed to shed some light on a practical use case on how to enhance customer intimacy using In-Memory Computing for business analytics.\r\n\r\n\r\n","notes":"Functions and Algorithms\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThe driving force behind the use case is ‘enhancing customer experience’. With this is in mind, every customer interaction is funneled for use in a sentiment analysis. By examining every chat, email, tweet, voice transcript and logs, the attitudes, emotions, likes, preferences, habits behind the interactions are analysed using the following (indicative) machine and deep learning algorithms:\r\n\t\r\nNaïve Bayes\r\nMax ENT\r\nSVM\r\nCNN, HMM, GMM, \r\nDNN, RNN, LSTM\r\n\r\nArchitecture behind Real-Time In- Memory Analytics \r\n==========================================\t\r\nThe following  architecture principles are applied in Predictive Real-Time Business Analytics :\r\n\r\n* Real Time, In Memory Process.\r\n* Loose coupling.\r\n* Interoperability.\r\n* Modularity.\r\n* Scalability with built in CAPS.\r\n* Cloud Centric.\r\n* Mobile Centric.\r\n\r\nBy design Highly stable, open source products are plugged into the solution.\r\n","abstract":"Till today technology has failed business leaders miserably who wanted information to make complex decisions in real time.

In your abstract, you say technology has miserably failed business leaders who wanted information to make complex decisions in real time. I'd rather say technology has often fallen short instead of failed miserably. Likewise, I think it's an overstatement to say that AI and real-time analytics are the single largest contributor to customer relations in history. What about the Internet? And another example of what sounds to me like an overstatement: \"Real time strategic decision making in digital era is impossible unless we shatter today’s speed and scale barriers\".\r\n\r\nI have a few suggestions from the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program:\r\n\r\n1) Description: The third paragraph under \"Disruptive Intelligence\" is one long sentence. Please try breaking it up. \r\n\r\n2) Description: The description uses too much space elaborating on the importance of real time strategic decision making, real time analytics and IMC. I think you should simplify the motivation part of the description and focus more on the technical presentation. And it turns out the technical part of the talk is a little vague. Are you going to talk about general solutions to real-time analytics and IMC? Or about a specific (of set of) solution/design/technology/framework/tool? Or is it a case study? \r\n\r\n3) Description: It's not clear what attendees will learn. For example, in the Notes you mention \"Architecture behind Real-Time In-Memory Analytics\". That would be an interesting topic for many attendees at SATURN, but is not mentioned in the talk Description (remember attendees see the Description, not the Notes).\r\n\r\nIn the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-14T22:51:41.283Z","updated_at":"2017-01-14T22:51:41.283Z"},{"id":3304,"submission_id":6442,"talk_id":12373,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Venkidapathy,\r\n\r\nThanks for your submission.  I think this seems like an interesting topic and one that many will find interesting.  There are a few things about the submitted abstract that I think can be improved.\r\n\r\n* The overall tone seems overly enthusiastic for the solution you're proposing, almost to the point that it reads like a sales pitch.  Surely there are some negatives to what you're proposing?\r\n* The topic is unclear and seems to touch on numerous areas.  Is this talk about AI? In memory data structures?  Streaming analytics?  Cloud? Mobile? Modular design?  I'm not seeing the theme or core lesson.

Okay, not really, but you are providing the equivalent as your user experience. This hurts your <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/responsive-design-ranking-factor-228464\">SEO potential</a>, and drives traffic away from your site.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s get a quick rundown on what responsive web design actually means within the context of an ordinary website. This definition from <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2013/05/what-is-responsive-web-design.html\">Small Business Trends</a> sums it up nicely:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Responsive Web design is an approach whereby a designer creates a Web page that “responds to” or resizes itself depending on the type of device it is being seen through. That could be an oversized desktop computer monitor, a laptop, a 10-inch tablet, a 7-inch tablet, or a 4-inch smartphone screen.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>So with this in mind, let’s take a look at hypothetical look at a website on a few different devices.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=690%2C224&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"multiple-devices\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=600%2C195&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=720%2C234&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\r\n<p>Guys…. Stop thinking about coffee and let’s focus!</p>\r\n<p>Maybe the importance of this isn’t really seeping in and maybe you’re more of a numbers person… Let’s try another route.</p>\r\n<p>80% of internet users own a smartphone per <a href=\"http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/\">Smart Insights</a>. According to <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/why_marketers_should_keep_sending_you_emails\">MicKinsey &amp; Company</a>, Google says 61% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site they had trouble accessing and 40% visit a competitor’s site instead. A report by <a href=\"http://visual.ly/mobile-web-usage-2015-and-onwards\">Wolfgang Jaegel</a> found that 91% of mobile users say that access to content is very important.</p>\r\n<p>In all seriousness, it is a big deal if your site does not work on mobile devices. Think about the kittens!!  And if you’re thinking, “there aren’t THAT many devices out there,” and “it can’t be THAT hard to be responsive,” think about those kittens one final time.</p>\r\n<p>I am sure there is a number out there on the internet waiting to be found telling us how many devices are web capable, and <a href=\"https://www.perfectomobile.com/list-of-supported-devices\">I am also sure it’s large</a>. Keep in mind each device is designed differently, with different software requirements, default browsers, and different hardware specs. That means, as a developer, no matter what you’re building, you will likely find yourself daydreaming of how many kittens you’d prefer were being hit in the face, while you debug the fifth CSS error you encounter in Safari, that never existed in Chrome&#8230;Sorry, that got a bit personal.</p>\r\n<p>As much as I would like to believe my iPhone is having an identity crisis, that’s not the actual case. There are standards out there for web design (sometimes sketchy ones), that are intended to help developers and browsers work within boundaries that help to simplify things. And I know what you’re thinking.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you, mobile gods. We’re saved!</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"design-gods\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\r\n<p>But we haven’t quite saved those kitties just yet.</p>\r\n<p>You may still be thinking, “Why do you need to know all this?”</p>\r\n<p>If you’re a business owner looking to increase your audience and you haven’t taken the responsive route, that should be the first thing on your to-do list. Online shopping is already a huge trend and still growing at this rate. If you’re trying to get your blog out there over a product, what better place for someone to read that than on their device while in the restroom? I mean really… we’ve all done it…</p>\r\n<p>If you’re looking to get a better <a href=\"http://www.marketpath.com/digital-marketing-insights/8-reasons-to-have-a-responsive-web-design-infographic\">return on your investment (ROI)</a>, responsiveness is another way to do that. If you do not have a fully responsive design, you are throwing away potential page views and potential dollars pulled in from your mobile shoppers.</p>\r\n<p>Now onto saving all those kittens!</p>\r\n<p>If you’re not familiar with WordPress or its standards, there are these things called themes. I mean, to take it directly from the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes\">WordPress Codex</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. These files are called template files. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>To put it simply, a theme is the look and feel of your site via functionality and design. It’s the idea that you can do anything with your content within the provided templates and have a consistent and clean flow.</p>\r\n<div><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=690%2C376&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"elegant-themes\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?w=970&amp;ssl=1 970w, https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=600%2C327&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=720%2C392&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p>Popular WordPress themes from Elegant Themes</p></div>\r\n<p>There are thousands of themes out there to pick from. Whether you’re building a store front, a restaurant front and menu, a non-profit donation location, a blog, or an educational site, there is something out there for you. There are many free options, usually offered through the CMS that’s been installed, and paid options that tend to be found via outside sources.</p>\r\n<p>So get to searching for the responsive theme that fits your needs, either through <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a> or through a seller like <a href=\"https://themeforest.net\">ThemeForest</a>. The kittens will thank you.</p>\r\n<p>If you go searching and nothing seems to catch your eye (insert joke about cats chasing the red dot of doom), there are always custom themes. This is the option for businesses that are looking for a specific look or functionality that they can’t find anywhere else. Being unique can be a huge benefit to a business with the right design and implementation. This is a costlier option but usually has a higher turn around on traffic and offers more options for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and design tactics. Marketing teams usually love this option!</p>\r\n<p>That’s it, that’s all you have to do.</p>\r\n<p>As developers, we have to do much much MUCH more to make something like a custom theme or purchased theme modifications (maybe I’ll write about that in the future for all the dev-heads out there wanting to help the kitties), but as a website owner using WordPress, that’s all you have to do; find a theme that is responsive. You can look more into the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack plugin</a> to help with SEO as well (yet, again, maybe another post for the future).</p>\r\n<p>So get out there and start saving those kittens! I believe you will make the right decision!</p>\r\n<p>Also, if you need some emergency kittens, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmrgencyKittens\">go here.</a> You’re welcome.</p>\r\n","notes":"This talk is great for those who are just starting to learn CSS or web design, but still helpful to those who have been creating sites for a few years. I try to not push too far into the depth of CSS with this talk but push more the audience to think about their user and their experience across multiple devices. As someone who works first hand with clients at Grok Interactive, I hear about all the pain points of older sites making a move to mobile and how visitors are hard to bring in, due to a lack of intuitive design. \r\n\r\nI'm also the person who usually discovers the state of a site before Grok gets to work fixing sites. I usually find developers have a hard time with layout concepts, basic min/max widths and the prevention of overlapping or loss information when rendering on a mobile device. I have come to understand many of the methods that everyone should have learned in the beginning of the design or layout teachings. \r\n\r\nI like to keep my talks fun for the sake of remembering the content. Dry content is usually the first to be forgotten, no matter how useful it may have been.","abstract":"Through CSS, Flexbox and SASS, there are many techniques to cut down the amount of work needed to make a website responsive for mobile.

Masinter, Intel Corporation \r\nNathan R. Peterson, Intel Corporation\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe Advanced Deterministic Random Number Generator (ADRNG) was developed at Intel Security for use with the many security products based upon the McAfee Linux OS platform. The ADRNG provides the NIST approved SP800-90A PRNG from the native Linux kernel API. It is continuously reseeded using high quality entropy bit data form the native Linux kernel Jitter entropy driver. This ADRNG is added to the Linux 4.4 kernel, and replaces the standard drivers for both /dev/random and /dev/urandom. The result is high quality random data delivered in high volume without call blocking.\r\n\r\nProblem/Opportunity\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe ability to provide a high volume of quality random data is of interest to modern Linux server systems where a great deal of encryption requires a great deal of random data. A lack of large quantities of random data may cause encryption to run slowly. A lack of quality in the random data may cause encryption to be weak. \r\n\r\nThe particular path that led us to develop this solution was increasing scrutiny of the NIST FIPS validation standards which are diving deeper into entropy quality. The ADRNG is based upon all the learning from a year long series of FIPS lab testing while validating McAfee Linux OS. \r\nQuality random data is in demande by all modern Linux servers, with or without FIPS requirements. By developing a standards based solution that plugs into the Linux kernel, we can easily share this solution with all groups at Intel, as well as making a significant contribution to the Linux kernel upstream.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe initial implementation of this idea was for the Linux 3.18 kernel. That kernel did not contain the native API for the SP800-90A PRNG nor the Jitter entropy driver. We back ported the Jitter enropy code from a later kernel, and adapted the SP800-90A routines from the Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) open source crypto library. This worked very well, but we were concerned about the large delta of kernel code required for this method.\r\n\r\nHowever since that time, we have moved to the Linux 4.4 kernel, which does contains both the SP800-90A PRNG and the Jitter entropy driver within the kernel native API. So we have updated our solution to use only the native kernel resources. This vastly reduces the size of code required, and also provides greater confidence for those that consume the solution.\r\nScope\r\n\r\nThe initial motivation to develop the ADRNG was to meet increasingly strict NIST FIPS standards. However we have enable this solution for all modes of the kernel. Thus all products based on McAfee Linux OS will benefit from the faster and higher quality random data. This results in faster and more secure encryption.\r\n\r\nMcAfee Linux OS is used by many products at Intel Security, and all of these products will implicitly inherit the advantages of the ADRNG as they each update to the lastest MLOS kernel. Increased security will benefit the reputation and sales of Intel Security products.\r\nEngineering teams working with cryptography on Linux systems, as well as Product Managers attempting to satisfy NIST FIPS standards, would all benefit from learning more about the ADRNG.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nFor measuring the results we quantify two values: Speed and Quality. \r\n\r\n### Speed Test\r\n+ Dell PE-R610 / Xeon E5540 / 2.53GHz\r\n\r\n.            64-Bytes  1K-Bytes  64K-Bytes  64Kx64-Bytes\r\n/dev/random  0m0.002s  0m0.002s  1h,36m,13s 103h,19m,46s\r\n/dev/urandom 0m0.002s  0m0.002s  0m0.008s   2m10.672s\r\nADRNG        0m0.002s  0m0.003s  0m0.036s   2m25.836s\r\n\r\nThe speed test was performed using this simple command for each algo and block size:\r\n$ time dd if=/dev/random of=/tmp/64_random.dat bs=64 count=1\r\n\r\nWe used memory based file system (/tmp/) to reduce file i/o overhead.\r\nWe can assume file i/o overhead is consistent between all tests, since all tests have the same number and size of writes.\r\n\r\n### Quality Test\r\n•\tDell PE-R610 / Xeon E5540 / 2.53GHz\r\n\r\n.             Entropy  Arithmetic-Mean     SCC\r\n/dev/random   7.999580    127.5092         -0.001245\r\n/dev/urandom  7.999960    127.4892         -0.000524\r\nADRNG         7.999962    127.5570         -0.001057\r\n\r\nEntropy bits per byte of perfect randomness = 8.000000\r\nArithmetic mean of perfect randomness = 127.5\r\nSerial Correlation Coefficient of totally uncorrelated data = 0.0\r\n\r\nThe quality test was performed using the “ent” program which applies various entropy quality tests to byte sequences. This test was run against the sum of all data produced by the speed test above, 4,260,928 bytes.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe ADRNG provides random data at the speed of /dev/urandom and with the quality of /dev/random. Thus crypto applications no longer need to choose between speed and quality, because the ADRNG provides both.\r\n\r\nLeadership\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe ADRNG will provide greater overall quality to all Intel products which incorporate it. The ISecG security products are measured in the industry by their speed and security. The ability to run encryption faster, and with higher quality, results is something that can be measured and leveredged by product marketing to maintain and extend the Intel Security market leadership.\r\n\f\r\nLessons Learned\r\nThere were so many lessons learned from the FIPS process that we could write a book on the subject. But in summary, to track and report quality, you must collect this info:\r\n\r\n+ FOR EACH: RNG, RNG-Seed, RNG-init, Entropy, Entropy-Seed, Entropy-init\r\n+ You must be able to show this info:\r\n+ Origin of algo\r\n+ Source code of algo\r\n+ Quality tests of algo\r\n+ Performance tests of algo on various hardware platforms\r\n+ Papers and Certifications of algo\r\n\r\nIt is far better to collect this info as you go through development, rather than going back at the end and attempting to compile this info.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n1.\tENT, a program which applies various entropy quality tests to byte sequences,   http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/\r\n2.\tNIST Special Publication 800-90A, Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators, Jan 2012, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf\r\n3.\tCPU Time Jitter Based Non-Physical True Random Number Generator, 2014, Stephan Müller, https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2014/ols2014-mueller.pdf\r\n","notes":"- I am the manager and co-founder of the McAfee Linux OS project at Intel Corp.

Any innovative design solutions?\r\n- challenges to create, evaluate, check conformance of the architecture.\r\n\r\nThe talk description should indicate what attendees will learn from your talk. \r\n\r\nClarification: there's no paper submission and publication for SATURN.

The resulting abstractions lead to more robust code at the core of your application, and can give your business a competitive advantage. We will apply this process to the Processing graphics library to develop a composable vector graphics system.","notes":"This is a 60 minute talk.\r\n\r\nAfter attending the talk, the attendee will be able to:\r\n\r\n1. Know the difference between Newtonian-style abstractions and Aristotelian-style abstractions. Aristotelian abstractions are built up piecemeal and are full of corner cases, like Aristotelian physics. Newtonian abstractions are elegant, formal, and composable.\r\n\r\n2. Follow a design process for developing an algebraic abstraction that can compose and easily express solutions (Newtonian style). Building data transformation pipelines is the step most people who are learning functional programming get to from reading and experimenting. Building algebraic abstractions is the next step, but there isn't much literature on the topic (outside of academia)\r\n    1. Elaborate a physical metaphor\r\n    2. Describe the meaning of your metaphor as mathematical statements\r\n    3. Construct the meaning using constructs from the language\r\n    4. Implement the abstraction by refactoring the meaning\r\n\t\r\n\tThe physical metaphor is an important first step that gives us an anchor from which we may use our intuition. We then query our metaphor for its properties and write them in math, which usually means types and equations. After that, we can construct a runnable version of the meaning, being careful to build it out of parts constrained by our statements from step 2. Finally, the implementation becomes an easy matter of refactoring our runnable version.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis topic idea comes from my experience teaching functional programming to people with all levels of experience. There seems to be a logical progression of insights that people go through as they learn about functional programming. I don't see many people getting past the \"data transformation\" step, so I want to present something further. It's hard to say whether it's THE next step, but it is at least one step beyond transformations.\r\n\r\nA lot of the thinking comes from my experience as a professional Clojure and Haskell programmer and the work of Conal Elliott, John Hughes, and Gerald Sussman.\r\n\r\nI have given a version of this talk at Clojure/conj 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJIUoaIvD20 I would love to adapt this to a language like JavaScript.

Scale is unclear - is this more of a programming-in-the-large or small approach or is it applicable at all scales? Is there evidence that the resulting abstractions are robust in practice?

The experiences you have to share sound very interesting.

The first paragraph is the short answer and the next two paragraphs are background and explanation.  Your interest is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThe model at CRA uses standards we developed for first data model for data collection which is bounded context.  In the ESRI data model we leveraged the Subtype and domains, where different subtypes drive the domains.  When we morphed the model into the ESRI standard electric utility model, the same holds true as the model is denormalized by mapping feature(i.e. transformer has a transformer layer rather than being one point feature in the point layer).\r\n\r\nThe modeling we applied has a time element.  There is a data collection stage of most any project which will require data to be normalized to geometry (points, lines and polygons representing features as electrical apparatus in the real world).  After this phase there is an information modeling aspect that requires use of standards to apply various third party tools and integrations.  The integrations vary depending on what solutions need to be integrated.  As budgets and priorities come into play the priorities are often different between power utilities.  However, Power utilities require Network Analysis and Power Outage Management Systems to maintain high systems availability.  The return on investment is staggering to implement the outage management and network analysis systems.  In addition the mapping must always tie to Work Management Systems.\r\n\r\nDepending on the Utility size, microservices are typically used, however, there may need to be some cost saving, less expensive integrations such as ETL to move data into another format (i.e. daily job).  This is what happened with CRA and happens with most Power Utilities (even most very large ones).  There is a second reason for the reason web services cannot always be used – much of it has to do with the industry needs a network model that has sufficient performance.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-09T13:43:04.671Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T13:43:04.671Z"},{"id":3157,"submission_id":7667,"talk_id":14587,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nThanks for your submission!

If you create an architecture that doesn’t give value to the customer you are wasting your time. When I talk to customers I often hear horror stories about how their current systems were developed by someone in an ivory tower who didn’t understand them or their work. So how do you make sure that you are bringing value to the customer through your architecture? Use customer centric design processes often called Contextual Design or Design Thinking. These are fundamental parts of Lean and Agile and this session shows how to use them in architecture with hands on experience. In this highly interactive session participants redesign a system by interviewing a customer, creating a prototype, reviewing it with the group, and getting feedback on their design. Using the methods taught in this class you can create value for your customer through your architecture and become their hero, or at least not the person in the ivory tower who is ruining their life.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nParticipants will learn basic methods of contextual design and design thinking and how they apply to the architecture of a software system\r\nParticipants will learn customer interviewing techniques to gain knowledge of the customer's functional and non-functional requirements\r\nParticipants will learn creating prototypes of their architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to give constructive feedback on an architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to receive constructive feedback on an architecture","notes":"My goal for this session is to help architects learn a customer centric design process. I learned this method from the \"Deciding what to Design\" course at Carnegie Mellon. The method is often called Contextual Design or Design Thinking. Its a fundamental part of Lean and Agile. I've rarely seen people show how these methodologies apply to architecture, so thats my goal for class.\r\n\r\nI use this process in my own work at GE and previously at Verizon.  I lead the End to End Customer Experience efforts at Verizon and enabled our architects and software engineers to talk to customers. I gave a talk on that experience at a past SATURN that generated a lot of interest.\r\n\r\nAt GE I am using this method to design a new CI/CD system for our Industrial Internet of Things platform called Predix. Customers (anyone who gets value from the system you are creating) really appreciate working with me. I find out very surprising things by using this method and create much better systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nA slightly modified version of this session has been given before at Code on The Beach and was well received.  I used the \"App for adding contact to network\" use case and it ended up being a common but complex enough task that the groups had plenty to design. The Code on the Beach session was 60 minutes long and I assigned roles to each team member. I didn’t have time to have feedback given to each group, but I think it is an effective way to leverage the knowledge in the room. I didn’t have time to fit in the last wrap up session either, which I think is critical for people to concrete the new information. I've added those two parts to this 90 minute session.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nParticipants will learn basic methods of contextual design and design thinking and how they apply to the architecture of a software system\r\nParticipants will learn customer interviewing techniques to gain knowledge of the customer's functional and non-functional requirements\r\nParticipants will learn creating prototypes of their architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to give constructive feedback on an architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to receive constructive feedback on an architecture\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participatory session will include the following:\r\n15 minutes\r\nIntroduction to Customer Experience Design\r\nIntroduce the hands on Exercise: Design a new system for adding a contact to your network (Linkedin, google+ , etc.)\r\nDivide session into groups of 4 or 5 people.\r\n\r\n10 minutes\r\nActivity 1: Determine what matters to the customer including their functional requirements and quality attributes by watching how they do the task in their natural environment and asking lots of “why’s”. I will ask each group to select someone in their group to be the \"customer.\" Each group will watch their customer collect a business card from a person and add a contact to their network of choice.\r\n\r\n25 minutes \r\nActivity 2: Design the system around the customer’s needs and document it in a prototype. The prototype should be as interactive as possible, not just a flow chart. Prototype should show the architecture elements. Because the “customer” is involved, the team should be constantly getting input from the customer on their on going design. They should also write down any assumptions they are making and any reasons they made design decisions. Finalize the prototype, the assumptions, design decisions, and what they learned from the process.\r\n\r\n30 minutes \r\nActivity 3: Review the prototype with the group. Receive feedback on design. About 5 minutes each group.\r\n\r\n5 minutes\r\nWrap up: Allow the small groups to meet one last time to discuss the feedback and make any changes to their design.\r\n\r\n10 minutes\r\nFinal Group discussion: Discuss what they learned from the session.

Variations for one-to-few, one-to-many, many-to-many. Tradeoffs. What to embed (_id / natural primary key / more than the natural primary key)?\r\n* However, if an object frequently needs to be accessed on its own, embedding may not be the best choice.\r\n* Don't embed very high cardinality documents on the \"many\" side. Variations and tradeoffs.\r\n* Don't denormalize a \"master\" field / document if it needs to be updated frequently. The cost of finding and updating all the instances may be too high.\r\n* If you frequently need to use data from documents from multiple collections when embedding is clumsy, don't be afraid of join at the application level.\r\n* Use the power of the Aggregation Framework for complex query requirements.\r\n* Get the best out of sharding. Choose shard keys for even distribution of writes and reads.\r\n\r\nFor Cassandra:\r\n\r\n* Again, model around the queries in your application.\r\n* Spread data evenly around the cluster.\r\n* Think of the database as a nested, sorted map data structure.\r\n* Denormalize for fast read performance. \r\n* Find the right balance between normalizing and denormalizing.\r\n* Using column names for values, and leaving the column value empty is OK.\r\n* Leverage wide rows for ordering, grouping and filtering.\r\n* Choose the row key appropriately to partition your records for good performance.\r\n* Segregate the read-heavy data from write-heavy data.\r\n\r\nAs suggested by you, I'll drop polyglot persistence, and model it as \"best practices for NoSQL schema design\". I think I should drop Neo4j, and limit myself to MongoDB and Cassandra for a more in-depth coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-31T17:28:11.274Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T17:28:11.274Z"}]}},{"id":6588,"submission":{"id":6588,"state":"waitlist","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2016-11-21T21:32:43.928Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T22:57:26.735Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8eBXGPl_5E&list=PLe9psSNJBf76DOOKMkDpyo_A5PfZk7JWc","rating":60.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["serverless","javascript","nodejs","awslambda","cloud"],"profile":{"name":"david@serverless.com","bio":"David Wells is a full stack developer at Serverless, Inc. in San Francisco.

So, I suggest in your talk you examine the tradeoffs involved in serverless solutions.

OpenGrok is written in Java, and is designed around the concept of cookies on every page (including the front page), and thus effectively cannot be cached or accelerated through a naive approach, due to the original architectural decisions that were made without considering their impact on the cacheability of the application.

We're going to discuss what serverless really means (hint: it's a way of abstracting OS-level infrastructure management from server-side application code), what the difference is between the various providers, why you would want to consider using a serverless architecture, and how you would go about implementing one.  We'll discuss greenfield development as well as a migration path for existing web applications.  Other interesting aspects covered will be how the development workflow will change and why, what testing will look like in a serverless world, and some pitfalls to avoid.  While a serverless approach can be applied to applications written in a variety of languages, Javascript will be the language used for this talk, so we will examine some of the popular serverless Javascript frameworks, including apex.js, claudia.js, and serverless.js.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in full-stack development, DevOps, micro-service architecture, containers, cutting operational costs, and/or just staying abreast with the latest application architecture approaches, this talk is for you.

Depending on time, we may get into testing, deployment, and other advanced topics.\r\n\r\nIn what situations would you recommend someone not adopt server-less architectures?\r\n-  The biggest benefits for serverless are 1) decreased complexity for developers - abstracting away  server-level administration and devOps tasks and 2) lower costs for applications on VMs that spend time idling.  So, for those that have a mature, stable, and effective devOps infrastructure that already abstracts server complexity from developers and for those whose VMs don't have much idle computing time, transitioning to serverless probably isn't going to be cost/risk-effective.  \r\n\r\n- There may be other reasons to not transition: risk aversion (\"this is too new and unproven\"), compliance (\"we neither own the data center NOR manage any of the VM infrastructure??\"), or simple mistrust (\"how do I know it's going to scale when I really need it to?\") It's important that application architects take into consideration their corporate policies, compliance and risk requirements, and organizational change tolerance when considering serverless.","created_at":"2016-12-19T19:19:47.874Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T19:19:47.874Z"},{"id":2928,"submission_id":7119,"talk_id":13610,"user":{"name":"David Aktary","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/5152/2013_THR_David_Headshot.jpg","email":"aktaryda@gmail.com"},"body":"Apologies for the odd message formatting above...

For example, [Mike Roberts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) associates serverless to the use of MBaaS (more common), or alternatively richer clients (SPA?) talking to services behind an API gateway. Your talk probably has a clear description of what a serverless architecture is to you, but I'm thinking a brief definition in the talk description itself would also be helpful to correctly set the expectations of participants looking at the conference program.\r\n\r\n2.

Unfortunately, many customers, managers, and developers have little understanding of how to specify, achieve, or verify quality goals.  Barry Boehm ranks qualities among his top 10 sources of serious project risk.\r\n\r\nThe SEI recommends that quality goals be identified in Quality Attribute Workshops (QAWs).  QAWs identify quality goals indirectly with scenarios and rely on “quality experts” to map scenarios onto quality goals.  Unfortunately, this indirect approach does not help customers make tradeoff decisions because of their poor understanding of quality relationships.  While scenarios are useful in describing some quality attributes, such as aspects of performance, they are not as useful for others, such as safety.\r\n\r\nWe propose an alternative approach based on the tailoring of a comprehensive quality attribute model to the needs of a project.  The model contains over 60 quality attributes.  Each attribute has over 30 characteristics including indicators and measures, supporting and conflicting qualities, threats and mitigations, and achievement and verification tactics.  The model also contains guidance on defining, achieving, and verifying quality goals.  The model is freely available at quality-aware.com.\r\n\r\nThis model distinguishes external qualities (visible to users e.g. reliability) from internal qualities (only visible to developers e.g. code readability).  We propose that goals for relevant external qualities be identified and defined in a tailoring workshop that includes most stakeholders.  Internal quality goals should be identified and defined in a meeting of technical management and senior developers.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will review the attributes model and simulate a tailoring workshop.","notes":"","abstract":"Identification of quality goals is hindered by poor understanding of quality attributes.

In the Talk Description, why is transformation capitalized in SOA Transformation?

Maybe there's more objective motivation for the specific transformations you will describe. \r\n\r\n2.

Things you could add to the description to make it more interesting: what technology transformation will you talk about? If it's monolithic to microservices, what do your monoliths looked like?

What tools and frameworks did you add to your runtime environment, development environment, continuous integration/deployment environment? \r\n\r\n6. I think the most challenging aspect of the monolith-to-microservice transition is finding the appropriate functional scope for the microservices. If they are too small, you may end up with chatty communications and lower autonomy and performance.

Please find some of my responses.\r\n\r\n1.\tIn the Talk Description, why is transformation capitalized in SOA Transformation? In particular, this phrase is not clear and somewhat intriguing: \"the Software Transformation journey we should have in a fast-moving environment, where the agility is the key\". Maybe there's more objective motivation for the specific transformations you will describe.\r\n\r\nMost of the organizations which grow very fast tend to first focus on getting things done quickly and later worry about getting things done in the perfect fashion. This kind of accustoms business stakeholders used to seeing quick results. It takes some time to realize the importance of SOA, standardization, governance. When an organization attempts to do a Transformation Journey replacing the majority of the monolithic code base with industry standard COTS/SAAS/Systems/Custom Built Systems, coupled with the transition to SOA there is still a level of impatience to see quick results. Also, there is an expectation that buying SAAS/COTS products means they would start working immediately. These misconceptions posed significant challenges for us to keep providing continuous Business Value as well as working towards accomplishing embracing SOA. So, on one hand, we were doing a major re-haul of our systems and on another hand also making sure that we embrace SOA as well as providing incremental business value. We accomplished SOA not in isolation but by coupling tangible business benefits spread over a period of time also delivering incrementally. Those are the details I would like to share and that’s the reason why I would like to call it an SOA Transformation. \r\n\r\n2.\tI think most of the material out there is settling to using microservices as opposed to micro-services.\r\nI’ll have this corrected. Thank you!\r\n\r\n3.\tIf you find that your talk is too long, I suggest removing the first topic (\"Rackspace - Business and System Perspective\").\r\nPlease see point 4.\r\n\r\n4.\tI think the description is somewhat vague, especially for a 90-minute session. If it's 90 minutes long, it takes the time equivalent to 3 30-minute talks, so the info should be clearly valuable. You mention a case study. Maybe you should say more about the case study.\r\n\r\nThe introduction around Rackspace - Business and System Perspective is supposed to say more about the case study. Based on the time that is allotted, I would get this condensed accordingly. I would ideally prefer 60 minutes. 90 minutes seems to be a stretch.\r\n\r\n5.\tThings you could add to the description to make it more interesting: what technology transformation will you talk about? If it's monolithic to microservices, what do your monoliths looked like? Java EAR apps? MS .NET? Where do you run your microservices? Docker? Kubernetes? What tools and frameworks did you add to your runtime environment, development environment, continuous integration/deployment environment?\r\n\r\nSure I would add more details. The presentation is more around how we introduced SOA, embraced a culture of SOA and the difficulties we faced in the transformation. We had a couple of huge monoliths built mainly using Python/Java and they had undergone many revisions. The processes that we had were initially divergent and people dependent. From there we moved towards SOA, standardization of technology, deployment processes, CI and partly CD, and we could add details around the exact technology selection and standardization process we have also including details about Docker and other technologies we use. The challenges that would be described would be more on the lines of the phased steps we took to provide incremental business value and to reduce risks which helped as accomplish a major transformation. This an ongoing journey and we would talk about how we are beginning to embrace Microservices.\r\n\r\n6.\tI think the most challenging aspect of the monolith-to-microservice transition is finding the appropriate functional scope for the microservices. If they are too small, you may end up with chatty communications and lower autonomy and performance. If a microservice encompasses functional contexts that is too large, you move closer to the monolithic model and may not significantly realize the microservices benefits. What approaches have you used to help define the size of microservices? Did DDD help?\r\n\r\nGreat point, As an enterprise organization, we have not gone into a spree of replacing everything into MicroService. We are finding right use cases where we really could provide value out of carving Micro Services or introducing new MicroServices. I plan to present a case study of one such real use case and the practical benefits we gained from it. We have applied DDD concepts like Bounded Context and also to further split into Sub Contexts to select MicroService Candidates which helps in defining an appropriate logical boundary. We have also beginning to introduce Micro FrontEnds. Also during our SOA Transformation, we had already begun to apply many of the MicroService Principles even though the term hasn’t become popular. We would also provide those details.\r\n\r\n7.\tWhat communication mechanisms did you use in microservices (what connector types)? Http (REST)? WebSocket? Asynchronous messages/events?\r\n\r\nWe have standardized on HTTP/REST. We had also build our own Messaging Infra Structure using REST: Atom Hopper. ATOM was used as the Messaging Standard across the Services. However within the Bounded Context Teams were free to pick appropriate messaging platforms.\r\n\r\n8.\tI think \"methods of how to accomplish large-scale technology transformations\" is quite ambitious. If you don't have exactly methods, but guidelines or best practices derived from experience, that's ok too.\r\nSure I would rephrase as per your suggestion.

The tutorial will cover why web security testing is important, what vulnerabilities are most common and how the ZAP tool can help developers check their software for these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe good and to improve:\r\nPrevious experience and presentations are listed, which increases the confidence that the presenter can deliver the material well. I like the fact that a live demo will be included. A video of a previous speaking engagement would be appreciated. I think this may be needed to get the confidence that the English accent of the speaker is easily understood.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the talk is on testing and the author’s experience includes mostly developer conferences. It is unclear how the talk’s take-aways are relevant for architects, clarification on this point would be helpful. For example, does ZAP help applying design patterns? That said, many developers attend SATURN and many architects code.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes listed are ambitious for a 15-min talk. It runs the risk of becoming a sales pitch for ZAP and an invitation to contribute to the project. Which leads to the following idea.\r\n\r\nIdea:\r\nI think the Technical Talks and Tutorials track may be more suitable.

The proposed session was for 1hr. I may have selected 15minutes talk format by mistake.\r\n\r\nTo keep the talk technology agnostic, I am not only focusing on ZAP security tool but also on other open source web security tools such as Vega Scanner, Open VAS, Nikto and Uniscan. \r\n\r\nDue to time constraint, I will be showing live demo only on ZAP. Its not gonna be like sales pitch at all. I am just using a tool to help me find the vulnerabilities in web application so that developer can know and build application more securely.\r\n\r\nIf my talk is accepted under Technical Talks and Tutorial track (assuming each talk will be given 1hr duration), my talk will be following below structure:\r\n\r\n-> Importance of Web Secuirty - 5min\r\n-> Discussing OWASP Top 10 vulneribities [Each vulnerabity will take 2min for discussion] - 20min \r\n-> Talking about 4 available open source tools [4 tools X 5min] - 20min\r\n-> Live Demo [Scanning vulnerable web application to detect vulnerabilities and various other features of the tool] - 10min\r\n-> QA - 5min\r\n\r\nAbout ZAP: \r\nThe OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world’s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by hundreds of international volunteers.

That’s why we also focused on creating a security culture within the company: making security a responsibility of everyone, not only the security team.\r\n\r\nTo not only create this culture in IT but also in the rest of the company, we organized Abuser Story workshops for Product Owners and Business Analysts. Abuser stories are a fun way of thinking about the security of your new features. It triggers to think of unhappy flows, think of thresholds to monitor and so on. Making the systems Secure by Design, something really relevant for architects. We saw that Product Owners consulted the security team and architects way more for advice when designing new systems, they gave room and time to developers to write secure code, and discussions between the Security and development teams were actually constructive. It helped to get the “security, we are in this together” mindset. \r\n\r\nIn this talk Jim will tell the journey of bol.com, the growing importance of security, and the way we tried to cope with it in a fun way.

I will try to answer your questions below and give some additional information.\r\n\r\nAbout what I will tell about how we embedded a security culture in the company:\r\nSo how do you already get that security mindset embedded in earlier stages. How do you get people excited to think about security? Security has the prejudice that it is boring, that is something you have to do, maybe because someone else says so. Like the security team/department. But security can also be fun! Fun? Yes! By stimulating the employees to think like a hacker, either technical or functional, they got motivated to think of security requirements by approaching it from the other side. This in combination with the right tools really helped to get our security level to high standards.\r\n\r\nSome more information about the Abuser Story Workshop:\r\nWith abuser stories we touch on a subject everybody worked with: user stories. Normally with user stories you define new functionality that you develop with the customer in mind. But how can this functionality be abused? We stimulate the colleagues creativity to think evil and create a hacker mindset for themselves. Turn it around: write an Abuser story: As a hacker, I want…, So that… We were surprised by the evilness of our colleagues – we had some real hackers among us. We do this by introducing a simple proces, let one team think about abuser stories (so how could you as a hacker abuse this functionality), and the other team about user stories on how to avoid abuse. After that the 'Attacking' team presents its abuser stories, which the other team needs to 'Defend' with one of their user stories. We then stimulate the Product Owners to braintorm about abuser stories at the kickoff of each new functionality, more or less facilitate their own workshop. The outcome is then translated in requirements for the different user stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are actually two ways of how you can approach this talk. \r\n\r\n1. A (comprehensive) talk about the journey of bol.com and how we embedded a security culture, where I will deep dive more in how we did this with the use of Abuser Story Workshops. This focusses more on how we created this security culture, and the lessons we learned from this proces.\r\n\r\n2. A short talk about the journey of bol.com and how we embedded a security culture, and facilitating a Abuser Story Workshop to illustrate how we did this. This focusses more on teaching you how you could facilitate these workshops yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\nRelevance for audience: the first is relevant for a broader audience, where the second talk (workshop form) is more relevant for Analysts and Product Owners.\r\n\r\nI hope this gives you more insights. If you have any questions or you want me to elaborate a bit more, just let me know.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJim","created_at":"2017-01-05T10:15:16.558Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T10:15:16.558Z"},{"id":3126,"submission_id":7384,"talk_id":14092,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks, Jim.

We want them to evolve with the needs of the business, its customers and stakeholders, and to be resilient in the face of ever changing market conditions and the external environment. This level of adaptability and responsiveness needs to be supported by the architecture of the systems we create. The complexity of the environment that architects find themselves in is increasing in recent years, with cloud, DevOps, continuous deployment, micro services and other elements adding to the factors that architects must consider. With this growing complexity, architects need to be supported by effective decision-making approaches.\r\n\r\nSize is also a factor. Larger systems and larger organizations have, by definition, a larger number of dependencies (internal and external) that must be managed, and a larger number of stakeholders (internal and external) whose needs must be addressed. The architecture of larger systems can involve hundreds or thousands of people, creating dozens to hundreds of products, components and subsystems that all need to work together. Maintaining the conceptual integrity of the architecture under such circumstances, and over time, presents many challenges and a greater need for coherence. \r\n\r\nTo navigate all of this, agile architects need to be adaptive; they need the ability to dynamically shift their decision-making approach to match the complexity of the circumstances they face. This session will describe how lessons from complexity science, and in particular, sense making and the Cynefin framework, can help architects to be more agile in how they work, and in turn, help them develop architectures that are more agile and adaptive to the needs of the organizations they serve.\r\n\r\n### Learning Outcomes\r\n* Applying sense making in the context of architecture\r\n* Applying the Cynefin framework to architecture problems and decisions\r\n* Examples of architecture problems and decisions that can be mapped to the different domains represented by the Cynefin framework (obvious, complicated, complex, chaotic and disorder)\r\n* How to manage the transition of architecture problems between these different domains\r\n* Implications for organization structure and communications\r\n* How such an approach leads to a more resilient architecture, and a more antifragile organization\r\n* How complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework supports emergent architecture\r\n* How complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework help the organization and the architecture to be more agile\r\n\r\n### Format\r\nFor a 90-minute workshop I typically use the following format. \r\n\r\nPart 1 (5 minutes):\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n* Overview of concepts\r\n\r\nPart 2 (10 minutes): \r\n\r\n* Architecture descriptions\r\n* Using narrative to understand architecture\r\n\r\nPart 3 (40 minutes):\r\n\r\n* Sense Making analysis of architectures and their influence on the organisation\r\n* Analysing the patterns that emerge from the sense making activity\r\n\r\nPart 4 (30 minutes):\r\n\r\n* The Cynefin Framework, and how it applies to architecture\r\n* Designing experiments\r\n\r\nPart 5 (5 minutes):\r\n\r\n* Debrief and wrap up\r\n\r\n","notes":"The majority of the session is highly participatory. All five parts outlined in the session description have some element of participation. Parts 2-4 are the major parts of the session. In part 2, I guide participants through sketching their architecture and creating narrative about their architecture. In part 3, I guide participants in analysing their architecture/sketch/narrative using a sense making framework. In part 4, I guide participants in understanding the Cynefin framework in more detail and designing an experiment to address complex challenges that emerge in the analysis. Parts 1 and 5 have less activity, but still have dialog and interaction.\r\n\r\nI will bring all the supplies that I need to run the exercise. It is more effective if the room is set up “banquet style”, with round tables that set groups of 6-10. \r\n\r\nI have been working with sensemaking and complexity for a few years now, and have run variations of this activity many times, both inside Cisco and at conferences and other forums. At the heart of this is the concept of applying sensemaking and the Cynefin framework to managing the complexity faced by architects. That complexity is not just in the architecture itself, but also in the problem domain, the organization, and the wider context within which architects do their work.\r\n\r\nMy background is in software engineering and architecture, in the context of product and systems development, and in transforming engineering organizations around the world. I use the techniques I present here in my own work, and I also help architects, engineers, and others, apply these techniques in their work.\r\n","abstract":"To create resilient and antifragile systems, architects must use decision-making approaches that help them better navigate the complexity of their environment.

Thank you for your feedback and review.\r\n\r\nYes, I will include real applications of this approach, together with experiences of how it can make a real difference.\r\n\r\nI will provide examples of complexity and challenges in both architecture and the organisation aspects. The exercises encourage people to use their own examples that we will work through for 90 minutes. I leave it completely open to whatever people bring. These invariably include organisation challenges as well as technology challenges. The approach in the session deals equally well with both.\r\n\r\nYes, the majority of the session is highly participatory. I will edit the content to reflect that, and make it apparent. All five parts outlined in the session description have some element of participation. Parts 2-4 are the major parts of the session. In part 2, I guide participants through sketching their architecture and creating narrative about their architecture. In part 3, I guide participants in analysing their architecture/sketch/narrative using a sense making framework. In part 4, I guide participants in understanding the Cynefin framework in more detail and designing an experiment to address complex challenges that emerge in the analysis. Parts 1 and 5 have less activity, but still have dialog and interaction.\r\n\r\nRegarding the article you refer to: yes, there is a relationship. We both draw on some of the same reference material.

We can then relegate all interpretations of those events to subsystems that are easy to build, change, and replace when necessary. The resulting systems have single responsibilities and are decoupled from each other, which makes them simple to modify. Event Sourcing can enable us to move faster by supporting rapid experimentation with new perspectives, new user interactions, and new insights into our business.\r\n\r\nEvent Sourcing is agnostic of technology stack and language style, but it goes well with another pattern called CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation. In this talk, we will do a deep-dive into the two patterns and scope out a system that has:\r\n\r\n* Receiving and validating Commands that, if successful, result in Events (with pseudocode to illustrate how it might work).\r\n* Interpreting Events into denormalised projections for very fast reads.\r\n* Single responsibility services for reacting to Events by creating other events and, if necessary, triggering external behaviour.\r\n\r\nWe will also cover more in-depth topics, such as:\r\n\r\n* Strategies for evolving events and event schemas over time.\r\n* Dealing with eventual consistency.\r\n* Popular technologies for various system components, such as how to store and distribute events.","notes":"This is a 90 minute talk.

In my experience this happens for a few reasons:  architecture documentation is rejected as being too heavyweight, documentation is typically out of sight and out of mind, and many developers don't know what to document.  Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), a lightweight documentation approach [proposed by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), solves these problems by recording design decisions in a simple markdown template in the same repository as the code affected by the ADR.  In this talk we will share our experiences and lessons using ADRs over the past year while working on multiple projects for IBM Watson.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk you will be able to create effective ADRs, introduce them to your team, and avoid common pitfalls with the method.","notes":"This talk is intended to be a 30 minute experience report.

ADRs Overview\r\n   * Nygard's proposal\r\n   * Connection to other work and research\r\n3. How we use ADRs\r\n4. Exercise: Create an ADR (optional, may fall out depending on timing, at most this is a 5-7 minute exercise)\r\n5. Case Study: IBM Watson Information Retrieval Enhanced team\r\n   * This section will include the proposed lessons and tips for adopting and using ADRs based on our experiences\r\n   * Create a common template that everyone agrees to use\r\n       * examples from case study\r\n   * Identify an architecture champion to point out when architectural design decisions happen\r\n   * Add ADR creation tasks to the backlog\r\n   * Use pull requests and peer reviews to teach people how to record a decision and to\r\n       spread konwledge about decisions\r\n   * Use ADRs to grow architects on your team\r\n       * Creating an ADR is a small slice of design responsibility.  It turns out to be a great way to\r\n           infuse the team with architectural thinking and train new architects\r\n   * Store ADRs with the code\r\n   * Works great with microservices where small groups of people and the code\r\n       they create work autonomously within a light governance framework\r\n   * Revisit old ADRs every so often to update them and ensure you have accurate reflection of current thinking\r\n6. Problems we ran into with ADRs and are still working through\r\n   * Plain text diagramming is a pain point.\r\n   * ADRs emphasize architectural decisions for a single component.  This is great for smaller projects and\r\n      individual microservices but falls apart when multiple architectural components stored in multiple code\r\n      repositories are involved.\r\n      * Our solution was to create an \"Architecture\" repository, which stored ADRs that cut across multiple\r\n         architectural components, linking to refinement ADRs as appropriate.\r\n   * Overemphasis on design decisions at the expense of other design documentation\r\n       * The team became awesome at recording ADRs to the point where they wouldn't document anything else!\r\n       * ADRs were smashing success.  Complementary methods that are as simple and lightweight are needed for\r\n          design concepts other than decisions.  examples: alternatives, governance policies, general design guidance,\r\n          quality attribute scenarios and other architecturally significant requirements\r\n7. Conclusion\r\n   * closing thoughts on using ADRs as a way to \"sneak in\" architecture\r\n   * great way to create a history of the project and explain not only where we are but how the system arrived at this point\r\n   * Show where ADRs fit as part of an documentation strategy \r\n   * Links to additional resources","abstract":"Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture key architectural design decisions in a lightweight, easy-to-create, plain text template stored in your existing version control system.

The two templates have the same goal in the end but collect slightly different information.  The ADR is significantly simpler, if nothing else.  I think a key difference and the thing that is kind of unique about Nygard's approach is in what is done with this information.  It sounds simple, but storing the design decisions in the version control system acted almost as a stealth way of injecting some of the ideas from Views and Beyond into the team.  What's more a small ecosystem of tools has sprung up around ADRs.  See https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools and https://github.com/holytshirt/dotnet-adr as examples.\r\n\r\nFinally, Thougtworks recently [classified ADRs as \"trial\" methodology](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records).

I first encountered the importance of maintaining Architectural Decisions ass a part of the SEI Views and Beyond book. I have been a great advocate and have used them ever since. I think its an important technique that needs good attention and would help many Architects attending the conference. The approach of understanding software architecture in terms of a variety of architecture decisions is now widely recognized.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do have a suggestion. Instead of the talk just focusing on ADR as suggested by Michael Nygard, what would be even useful is discussing the approaching of Documenting Architecture Decisions as a whole, which decisions to document and not, the payback/benefits and the variants available for documenting them along with your case study.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am concerned about the idea of just storing the Architecture Decisions in isolation without many other significant Architectural Artifacts. I understand that the Thoughtworks seems to recommend including them in the “trial” methodology. However, I am just concerned with the misnomer that these are the only set of significant artifacts for all cases. Could the details be presented more on the lines of Evolutionary Architecture.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-04T06:17:59.216Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T06:17:59.216Z"},{"id":3066,"submission_id":7391,"talk_id":14103,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Yogeshwar, thanks for your feedback!\r\n\r\nI share your concerns and plan to address them in the talk.  I mentioned the points you raise under section 6.  I am certainly not suggesting this is the only set of artifacts required and recognize this is a trap teams easily fall into -- one of my teams did!\r\n\r\nWith respect to deciding when to document a decision vs. not, I plan to cover that under 5.4 and 5.5.  It turns out that people don't always know or recognize when an architectural decision has been made.  Pull requests and explicit architecture tasks combined with pairing was how we worked through some of those issues, in addition to including clear guidance in our template.  Basically we created situations for on the job training over time.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to attempt to place this technique within the context of the broader literature, as you suggest.  As you also point out, the idea of recording decisions is not new and is a commonly understood good practice.  The point of this talk is not to retread old ground but to look at good practice from the perspective of a newer method that people actually use and seems to resonate well with developers.  These ideas have been around for a while, and yet few teams practice them.  Why?  I think this method is another incremental step in the right direction.  By the end of the talk people will be armed with the knowledge they need to be successful with the method, not just try it out.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMichael","created_at":"2017-01-04T14:17:27.098Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T14:17:27.098Z"},{"id":3075,"submission_id":7391,"talk_id":14103,"user":{"name":"Yogeshwar Srikrishnan","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33bed537dc2a17123b3491737913e0a9?s=500","email":"yoga80@yahoo.com"},"body":"Thanks for the detail!

The updates do help to answer my questions, but it does leave me with a couple of concerns.\r\n\r\nThe first is still regarding the the claim: \"Deploy any application to any environment using any tool-set – for free.\" \r\n\r\nWhen you say \"free\" do you mean free of licensing cost, or free of the cost of \"the operational and technology overhead.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim that it is free of licencing cost is valid, with a few caveats.  The tools being integrated are free of charge and Electric Cloud can be free for up to 10 community hosts.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not so sure about the claim regarding overhead costs.  As you say earlier in the submission: \"the operational and technology overhead of orchestrating the hand-offs from one tool to the next in the process are not without cost.\"  The later claim that you\r\n\r\nDoes electric cloud eliminate costs for ANY tool, or only the tools for which a plug-in already exists?   What about tools that do not have an existing plug-in?  \r\n\r\nMy second concern is that the presentation feels like product demonstration.  It appears to introduce the problem of overhead costs for automation and orchestration and then present Electric Cloud as the solution to that problem.\r\n\r\nThe audience of Architects would like to go deeper than that.  They would be interested in seeing how Electric Cloud is solving this problem.  What are the underlying patterns and principles adopted by Electric Cloud in order to reduce the total cost of ownership for software delivery pipelines?\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\n\r\nGed","created_at":"2017-01-04T08:44:18.442Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T08:44:18.442Z"},{"id":3097,"submission_id":7179,"talk_id":13725,"user":{"name":"Avantika Mathur","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7991eeae861b2945ebb8ebaca2f54d2e?s=500","email":"oheel@catapultpr-ir.com"},"body":"Hi Ged -\r\n\r\nHopefully these help answer some of your questions: \r\n\r\n1.

In terms of the structure of the talk, it tends to flow like the following.  Any additional comments or suggestions are welcome...I'm happy to adjust the content or flow to better fit the event as needed.\r\n\r\n- Intro to Blockchain: Why the sudden attention?  Issues addressed when compared to current business models.\r\n- Basic Blockchain Concepts (e.g. what is a block?  how does a blockchain achieve \"immutability\", and other common terms)\r\n- Use Cases (showcase the use of blockchain technology beyond cryptocurrency, using various verticals as examples, including IoT, Healthcare, Supply Chain, Digital Rights Mgmt)\r\n- \"Flavors\" of a Blockchain (public/private/permissioned/permissionless, on-premise or cloud)\r\n- Smart Contracts (pulled out as a separate item, given the ability of this feature to change the way that businesses interact)\r\n- Besides a blockchain, what else is required?

Regarding the hands-on techniques for visualizations - I use a blend of storymapping with domain modeling to focus on 'what architecture when'.  I also use a simple quadrant that weighs architectural impacts on cost of being wrong and ease of change to talk considerations that might move more decisions to be lower cost / easier to swap (though not always the case).\r\n\r\nWhere this gets into micro services and cloud computing is using these - namely storymapping - to drive domains for services and inject some chaos thinking into cloud computing - if this service were to go down, what is the impact on the product and what should it be?  What is the cost.  \r\n\r\nI delivered a similar talk a few months back at Surge Conference in DC though it was an hour - the video was posted, but they have revved their site for the 2017 conference and I cannot find it a direct link to it.

Started when github didn't have free privato repos and haven't migrated yet. I will definitely post it in the coming days/weeks. The bot is built with Microsoft Bot Framework (nodejs version) and I am hosting it on Azure right now. I can host on heroku as well, it doesn't really matter. From there it's APIs all the way down. Moltin as my e-commerce backend. Moltin is a young UK startup, recent Y-Combinator graduate. Azure Search (ElasticSearch) for search as Moltin doesn't have a built-in search yet. LUIS from Microsoft Cognitive Service for natural language understanding and then finally Recommendations (also from Microsoft Cognitive Services). In my talk I am explaining how a message sent by the user goes through intent recognition (sometimes LUIS-powered and sometimes not) and then translates to API calls (e.g. search or e-commerce transaction). \r\n\r\nHappy to provide more details.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPavel Veller","created_at":"2016-11-05T18:34:26.659Z","updated_at":"2016-11-05T18:34:26.659Z"},{"id":2180,"submission_id":6246,"talk_id":12062,"user":{"name":"Pavel Veller","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/27d6b5b76fd03074e7a99986c5e9d59a?s=500","email":"Pavel_Veller@epam.com"},"body":"And jut in case if it wasn't clear from my submission - the bot is built.

I agree this is an important topic for organizations that want to move to continuous deployment, especially when their systems use shared databases. Database changes are not handled directly by Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. You need something else tool-wise. \r\nIn our organization we are using Flyway. One of the challenges we are facing is that the DBAs lose operational control over table schemas. That's less of a problem if each system (or microservice) has its own dedicated database. But in many enterprise IT environments, there's still some centralization of database changes. Continuous delivery/deployment with Flyway (or similar) will typically ask developers to author DDL statements that will eventually be automatically executed in production upon system initialization.

Please find more information you have asked for below.\r\n\r\nWhat is your definition of chaos engineering?\r\n\r\nIn our definition, Chaos Engineering is a discipline where we will simulate real world failures which occur rarely and cause catastrophic losses to the systems. This is much more important in cloud environments where we have completely relinquished the infrastructure management and high level service management to the cloud provider. Traditional testing mechanisms do not cover such self inflicted failures. Using Chaos Engineering tools, applications can subject themselves to failures and measure their resiliency.\r\n\r\nHow do you commonly work with teams to improve their microservices?\r\n\r\nAs part of integration and performance testing of applications, we engage them and set them up with cloud detour, the chaos engineering tool. The application teams can then start registering various failures against the application and infrastructure. For example random termination of servers and high CPU simulation affecting the processes. This will help evaluate how the microservice performed against the failures and if it still met the NFRs.\r\n\r\nhow generally applicable the solution you use at Capital One is or whether it is highly specific to your needs\r\n\r\nThe solution is very generic for applications deployed in AWS. Any AWS deployed application will be able to use the various aspects of solution whether the application just uses Infrastructure services like EC2 or higher level application services like ECS/S3\r\n\r\nAdditional information on AWS and general availability\r\n\r\nThe tool received a great feedback in its initial pilot and currently being aggressively adopted by various divisions. Over next few months, we will be able to make it Open Source ready for the community use. Also one of our objectives is to build an abstraction layer over the capabilities and make it available in other cloud providers like Azure and Google cloud. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSathiya \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-22T03:04:34.247Z","updated_at":"2017-01-22T03:04:34.247Z"},{"id":4264,"submission_id":7834,"talk_id":14873,"user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Sathiya,\r\nThanks for your submission.

Since today we pursue the \"automation of all things\", I think the description should say to what degree the solution uses automation and integrates to CI.\r\n\r\n2. You mention mission critical applications, but don't qualify the applications any further. You could be more specific in the description. For example, the solution may work for failure testing of services that expose http endpoints, but not for failure testing of services that consume JMS messages. \r\n","created_at":"2017-02-06T14:08:37.828Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T14:08:37.828Z"},{"id":4381,"submission_id":7834,"talk_id":14873,"user":{"name":"Sathiya Shunmugasundaram","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17dc934bfd849e2c5ee19de1cac59009?s=500","email":"sathiya.shunmugasundaram@capitalone.com"},"body":"Paulo - Great feedback, thank you. I have updated the abstract addressing your comments as below, please review.\r\n\r\nCloud is ubiquitous, but failures are unavoidable and unpredictable raising uncertainty and are risk to the systems. Traditional approaches can’t predict all failure modes because of changing data conditions, complex request patterns, ever increasing innovation and growing scale. Chaos engineering is a discipline to simulate these failures. In our cloud-detour solution, we describe how mission critical applications like high volume customer facing web applications or critical batch applications using compute/storage/networking services in the cloud can register themselves in an automated way to test against several failure scenarios and demonstrate their resiliency level.  This can help application engineers assess and provide adequate resiliency and solid disaster recovery strategy. Cloud Detour itself is management free with Serverless implementation and can be integrated with application CICD pipelines and provides approval workflows with application owners, application health checking before and after disruptions and alerting.

From small devices to houses, the IoT is leading more and more things into the digital fold every day.  Sensors are necessary to turn billions of objects into data-generating “things” that can report on their status, and in some cases, interact with their environment.  At the moment, cities are at a crossroads where they must choose to either use or lose the transformative potential of big data. Advances in AI and the widespread availability of sensors have provided us with powerful applications that allow us to perform daily tasks by analyzing the huge amount of data.  The insights to be gained from data are endless.  In the light of this a new paradigm of combining AI and IoT has emerged, in which the quality of life could be increased through the use of big data and cloud technology.

We treat connectors as self-contained, physical (i.e. binary), identifiable special-purpose components that isolate interfaces from communicating components. We intentionally place interfaces contained in connectors in the forefront of any kind of component system. \r\n\r\nThrough interfaces in connectors, components can be supplied with extra-functional services, such as the monitoring and budgeting of system-resource usage, the profiling of architecturally relevant components, and the checking of communication protocols. These services are beneficial for industrial systems that are maintained and evolve in the field. Connectors are a means of realizing blue/green deployments, canary releases, and performance monitors; all of which are necessary for DevOps scenarios that work in industrial environments. Connectors take over these tasks. Components can focus on their core businesses.\r\n\r\nEven without any extra-functional services, connectors provide two significant advantages to the development and operation of resource-constrained, safety-critical embedded systems. Firstly, connectors physically decouple communicating components, in the sense that components depend on (reference) connectors but connectors do not depend on components. Secondly, for implementation connectors do not need heavyweight component frameworks or middleware as usually in distributed systems.\r\n\r\nConnectors can be built for and operated in rich runtime environments such as .NET CLR, and in thin runtime environments such as crt0 for C++ programs. Basically, for our purposes, build and runtime environments need only to support interfaces in the sense of the identically named language concept and linkable compilation units. To build connectors of different kinds, we use several techniques and design patterns of different pattern languages in various combinations, for example Factory, Strategy and Decorator from E. Gamma et al., Registry from M. Fowler, Bounded Context from E. Evans and Insulation from J. Lakos.\r\n\r\nThe presentation is divided into four parts. In the first part we introduce the minimal connector and explain the consequences and benefits for developing, testing and configuring component systems. In the second part we develop the minimal connector into light connectors containing plain interfaces (call and callback) and then into heavy connectors with additional extra-functional services. In the third part we apply connectors for structuring a system whose development follows the DevOps methodology. In the fourth and final part, with a better understanding of our motivation, objectives, nature, assemblage and application of connectors in our practice, we work out similarities and differences in comparison with the Interceptor pattern from D. Schmidt et al. and component-and-connector views (SEI: Documenting Software Architectures, 2nd ed.).","notes":"","abstract":"Physically independent connectors decouple components without performance costs.

We took these examples from fault-tolerant, safety-critical systems which we are primarily dealing with in our daily work.

I have a few comments on specific assertions you make in the talk description. \r\n\r\n1. \"We view software architectures as systems of connectors.\"  Well, architecture is more than that. The literature on software architecture today is clear to say that software architecture encompasses multiple *views* (or perspectives, viewpoints). An architecture view that shows the components (runtime elements) and connectors is one of them. But a view that describes, for example, how the source code is organized in layers, or packages, namespaces is also part of the software architecture. A view that shows how different components are allocated to different hardware elements or nodes is also part of the software architecture. A view that shows the data entities and their relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many) in a data centric information system is also part of the software architecture. So, I think this statement should be more flexible to say something like \"An important perspective of any software architecture is the one that shows a system of connectors.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"A connector is a self-contained, physical (i.e. binary), identifiable special-purpose component that isolates interfaces from communicating components.\"  There are overloaded definitions of components and connectors out there. I particularly like the ones in \"Documenting Software Architectures, Second Edition\". This book says a \"Components are the principal computational elements and data stores that execute in a system.\"  Then it says \"A connector is a runtime pathway of interaction between two or more components.\"  The book makes clear that connectors are first-class citizens in the software architecture. But your definition seems too strict. For example, when a Javascript web page (the client component) makes an http call to a REST service (the server component), I see the http communication as the connector. However, in my architecture I don't have a physical, binary, identifiable element for that connector.  I also find it confusing to say that a connector is a (type of) component. Conceptually, it's easier to separate components from connectors.\r\n\r\n3. \"Connectors are a means of realizing blue/green deployments, canary releases, and performance monitors\". Often times, performance monitoring, logging, and other similar functionalities are performed by interceptors. An interceptor is not a connector, it's a special type of component. It's special because it is not called directly, it does not have a visible interface; instead, the interceptor will \"listen\" to the communication and will intercept messages/calls/events of interest. In the example I mentioned (JS component talking to a REST service), an interceptor could intercept the http calls for monitoring, logging, routing, message transformation, security controls. \r\n\r\n4. \"Firstly, connectors physically decouple communicating components, in the sense that components depend on connectors but connectors do not depend on components.\"  The level of coupling actually varies based on the type of connector. For example, an EJB client component will use the EJB-specific RPC connector to call the EJB component. That EJB client is tightly coupled to the EJB. OTOH, if a Java component sends a message to a JMS queue and there is another Java component that consumes messages from that queue, these two components are indeed decoupled because of the presence of the message queue connector. \r\n\r\n5. \"In the third part we apply connectors for structuring a system whose development follows the DevOps methodology.\"  I'm thinking much of what you call connectors is actually about interceptors. A DevOps strategy asks for health and performance monitoring that is visible to Devs as well as Ops. Much of that functionality is achieved by interceptors often provided by tools such as API gateways, zabbix, etc. \r\n\r\nI'm being picky wrt the use of core architecture concepts, but your talk seems pretty sound and valuable. \r\n","created_at":"2017-02-07T12:53:05.916Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T12:53:05.916Z"},{"id":4392,"submission_id":8138,"talk_id":15470,"user":{"name":"Joachim Fröhlich, Florian Krautwurm, Markus Lachenmayr","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f17b85f0f3df832a3bfbce052a9e3ce8?s=500","email":"florian.krautwurm@gmail.com"},"body":"Dear Paulo,\r\n\r\nthank you for your valuable feedback.\r\n\r\nWhile not able to address all your points, we have improved the talk description, in particular regarding connectors and the interceptor pattern.\r\n\r\nWe focus indeed on physical connectors, first-class citizens in the software architecture. Reduced to the minimum, a connector in our practice only contains one or more related interfaces (types) without implementations, and a somewhat special factory.\r\nAs the name suggests, interfaces are between components. Interfaces do not belong to the components communicating through interfaces, locally or remotely, sequentially or in parallel. In fact, we argue that interfaces rather than components carry component-based systems of any kind -- not just of distributed systems or of systems that rely on generalized middleware (component frameworks) containing or enabling interceptors. These thoughts should point out particular properties and advantages of \"our\" connectors and some differences to interceptors and to Aspect-Oriented Programming as well. \r\n\r\nWe will compare and contrast related work, views, and approaches in the new fourth part of the presentation. It will reference the work of SEI on Component-and-Connector Views, Shaw and Garlan as well as that of Schmidt et al. and others.\r\n\r\nKind regards.","created_at":"2017-02-08T16:46:25.034Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T16:46:25.034Z"}]}},{"id":7980,"submission":{"id":7980,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-13T01:00:10.560Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T22:52:24.860Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh7w4jw3930","rating":75.0,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["continuous integration","continuous delivery","continuous deployment","devops"],"profile":{"name":"Suzie Prince","bio":"Suzie Prince is Head of Product for ThoughtWorks Products building pioneering tools for software development teams.\r\n\r\nShe practices continuous integration and continuous delivery everyday to deliver quality software to end users.\r\n\r\nShe likes pushing buttons to release software, feature toggles and user feedback.

Architecture validations are becoming part of the processes used by IT groups to ensure software quality, and architecture review knowledge, reference materials and trained resources are becoming increasingly available. \r\nContinuous customer feedback is the best way to validate a software product and indirectly its architecture. Unfortunately, the system needs to be fully delivered in order to get that valuable feedback, and the cost of adjusting a software architecture after the system has been delivered is usually very high. The objective of the architecture validation techniques we describe in this presentation is to ensure that the future system meets its business objectives and quality attribute requirements, without slowing down the pace of delivery associated with Continuous Delivery.\r\nArchitecture validations deal with far more than just the technical issues, since business drivers are a key force in shaping an architecture. One of the key benefits of continuous architecture validations is that they periodically review the relations between business goals and architecture. As a result, they ensure that the system is designed, built and delivered in a way that provides the greatest benefit for its stakeholders.\r\nThis presentation describes how our approach can be leveraged to validate architectures in any type of project, and especially in a Continuous Delivery project.  First we define what we mean by Architecture Validation. Then we focus  on when to conduct Architecture Validations. We then discuss the roles required in an Architecture Validation. We finally detail how we can conduct architecture validations by describing some industry recognized techniques such as questionnaire-driven approaches, scenario-based approaches (including SEI's ATAM) and decision-based approaches (such as DCAM).\r\nIn order to illustrate the concepts introduced in this presentation, we will use a real-life example of Continuous Architecture Validation, showing how various approaches can be combined to effectively validate a project.","notes":"Murat Erder (Deutsche Bank, London) will be a co-presenter.

Adapting to Continuous Delivery is a problem that I am personally dealing with and performing Continuous Architectural Validation looks like a useful approach.\r\n\r\nI do have a couple of questions that I would like to ask.\r\n\r\nFirstly, you make the following assertion : \"Of course, the Continuous Customer Feedback Loop is the best architecture validation process.\"  \r\n\r\nI understand that this term is widely used in industry, but it may be new to many Architects.  Is knowledge and acceptance of the Continuous Customer Feedback Loop required by audience members or will you explain the concept and the reasons for adopting it? \r\n\r\nSecondly, you say that at the session will end as follows:  \"Finally we give a real life example of Continuous Architecture Evaluation in practice, showing how various approaches can be combined to effectively validate a project.\"  \r\n\r\nIs it possible to introduce the real life example earlier in the presentation?  Personally I have always found it easier to understand new concepts when they are introduced in a practical real life context.  It would be helpful if the example could be introduced earlier and then used to provide context to the various approaches being described.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\n\r\nGed","created_at":"2017-01-03T11:57:47.191Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T11:57:47.191Z"},{"id":3029,"submission_id":7262,"talk_id":13857,"user":{"name":"Pierre Pureur","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ea29b28608b1ff9b17f749cbd53764d6?s=500","email":"pierre.pureur@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Ged,\r\nThank you for your great (and very useful) feedback.

ATAM is an example. Strictly speaking, \"Continuous Customer Feedback Loop\" is not an architecture validation process. So, instead of saying \"the Continuous Customer Feedback Loop is the best architecture validation process\", maybe you could say something like \"Continuous customer feedback is the best way to validate a software product and indirectly its architecture\". \r\n\r\nIs the approach specific to cloud-based software solutions?

Your approach challenges this, and I would like to see some comment in your talk about it. Is conceptual integrity not important? Or is it over-interpreted, and you have a lighter-weight definition that works in practice? Or is it possible to achieve conceptual integrity with a distributed architect (and if so, what is the key)?\r\n\r\nThank you.

In this talk I discuss integrity on several levels: \r\n\r\nFirst, not all of the alternatives I present are actually a departure from persons or small groups driving the architecture. \"Marshalls\" are typically accountable for a cross-cutting concern spanning the whole system or big parts of it. They look after integrity in architectural approaches assotiated with security, performance or recurring technical problems with infrastructure etc. So the classic architect is splitted, but not in a functional fashion as the system itsself.\r\nAlso the approach of an architecture owner encapsulates important topics in one person. In this case it is a person with general overview, experience and a broad vision. He is more of a mentor and rises important topics. He isn't the one who decides and designs everything though. This is mapped to a team where he has the same possibilities and tools as everyone else. Conceptual Integrity is an important driver for him though. \r\nOnly one of the presented options goes without a person or team explicitly and foremost responsible for the architecture. \r\n\r\nSecond, the integrity of a system has big advantages in productivity, maintainability and derivatively in reliability, security and so on. Nevertheless it comes at a cost and many modern systems see conceptual integrity as a scale, where the maximum is not the ultimate goal. We could for instance define a minimum of common ground that works for a given project. Could be the deployment model, the general structure, the monitoring and security approaches and some interface standards. Inside these general rules a team could in fact develop solutions that are structured very differently and possibly use other technologies than other teams of the same project. Of course this poses problems in reusability and the other areas stated, on the other hand the teams can act on their own and usually deliver value faster. If the architectural drivers and the context allow it, a little less integrity could be optimal for a project.\r\n\r\nThird, even without an architect that predefines approaches and tactics we were able to achieve a good level of architectural integrity. Integrity is driven by a good engineering process, broad architectural knowledge, experimenting developers and some kind of \"natural selection process\". This selection process includes that good solutions are broadcasted to all teams and their adaptation is made easier. Bad ideas or the divergence from a known best practice should be harder to implement. In the acstract I call that \"low viscosity design\". Architecture then focuses on the identification of good approaches, the support of their communication and the creation of space to abstract good solutions and make them more universal. This is another form of architectural work as the \"standards-first\" approach, with arguably lower conceptual integrity, but often faster innovation, better flexibility and more realistic architectural concepts. A combination of top-down and bottom-up architectural approaches is a good fit for most projects I work on, low viscosity can shift the boundary a little in the bottom-up direction without causing direct chaos.\r\n\r\nAll of these topics are introduced in this talk, not all of them are covered in great detail. I am open to shifting the focus of the talk a bit if certain aspects sound very interesting for you. The 90min version will have a deeper look and also an exercise on some veto-mechanisms we use to broaden the accountability but not lessen the influence of good architects.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nStefan","created_at":"2017-01-31T15:20:11.449Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T15:20:11.449Z"},{"id":4436,"submission_id":8183,"talk_id":15549,"user":{"name":"Stefan Toth","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/09f421cbcb8ddf7506526e1096672630?s=500","email":"stefan.toth@embarc.de"},"body":"Thank you for accepting my talk for SATURN 2017!

While there is some work in this field, most of it has been devoted to metrics and estimates. Metrics are shadows of snowflakes, and thus not particularly informative when seeking to understand the purpose of a system or the behavior of a component. Improving estimation, while an interesting application and a laudable goal, likewise does not directly help developers create better software faster, nor manage the growing complexity of real-world systems. Can we apply ML in ways that help guide development, inform software archaeology, and reduce effort for developers? If so, can these things help us take on the systems-of-systems-of-systems of the future, where million-line code bases will be considered \"quaint\"?\r\nAfter a brief survey of existing/past work in the area, we'll investigate the question of \"what does software look like\", examine the more interesting question of \"what does good software look like\", and use these insights to explore how we can enable developers to create and manage ever-larger software systems.

To your questions -\r\n\r\n- I will show some of the 'semantic drift', clustering, and visualization work that I've been doing, which *should* be open-sourced by the time of the conference\r\n- re 'design systems differently to take advantage of the work': yes and no :) Using latent semantic analysis on software systems works best when the software source code uses relevant words from the domain (otherwise the software just talks about itself, i.e. what it is doing in stead of why it is doing things); the more domain knowledge/model/words that are embedded in the code, the better. I am explicitly using domain-driven design structures (bounded contexts, context maps) married with semantic visualizations (topic maps derived from natural language processing word-vector vocabularies) as a yardstick for what \"good\" software looks like .\r\n- yes. My work in this area started because of a real problem: trying to quickly understand a 2-million-line codebase. I have applied earlier versions of the tools to real-world projects (e.g. mapping 72,000 stories and 8,000 classes into the same semantic space), and continue to do so.

How many devs, how many ops, number of applications/microservices involved, size of the infrastructure. \r\n\r\n2. SATURN has a diverse international crowd. Please consider using more generic terms instead of PHI and PII. Likewise, you may add a short sentence that clarifies how big is UPMC. Many attendees will not know it's one of the largest health care organizations in the US. \r\n\r\n3. In the Notes, you say \"in this initiative we leveraged packages provided by several vendors (Amazon, Microsoft, Dell, and others) and open source software such as GitHub, Artifactory, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes.\" I think you should move that sentence to the Description, which will be visible to conference participants, and will catch their attention. \r\n\r\n4.

A disavantage of typical RPC solutions that has bothered us is the need to distribute stubs to client applications. \r\nIt negatively affects deployability. I hope you'll comment on that in your presentation. \r\nYears ago in our organization, a feature that motivated the use of RPC (EJB in our case) is the ability to run distributed transactions (ACID-like with 2PC).

Our architecture pattern languages have changed as have our development, deployment, and operating procedures (DevOps).  \r\n\r\nDuring this transition, one source of ideas has been the functional programming community.  Functional programming itself mostly happens within a module and indeed many software architects treat it as an implementation choice, unrelated to architecture.  But it turns out that some ideas from the FP community are helpful in architectural design: statelessness, immutability, and pure functions.  They underlie DevOps practices and are at the core of many distributed systems patterns at the core of our architectures.\r\n\r\n## Why now?  \r\nFunctional programming ideas have been around for a long time but conditions are ripe.\r\n\r\n1.  Coping strategy for complexity.  As systems get bigger but our brains stay the same size, we invent tech to cope.  Statelessness, immutability, and pure functions make it easier to reason about how a system behaves.\r\n2.  Problems grew in size.  No single computer big enough to run a system.  FP ideas suited to parallelism and concurrency, so many smaller computers can solve big problems.\r\n3.  We have more money than sense.  You can buy 100 cloud machines for less than one junior developer.  So why not do Continuous Integration with every source code commit?  Why not have a farm of servers running different versions of your code during deployments?  Why not burn RAM with immutable data structures?\r\n\r\n## Functional ideas in modern architectures\r\n\r\n1. Client-side.  Reactive patterns and frameworks.  Eg React, CycleJS, Elm.\r\n2. Server-side.  So-called \"serverless\" pure functions.  REST architectural style.  Reactive services.  Event queues between services.\r\n3. Persistence.  Append-only datastores.  Event sourcing & Command Query Response Segregation (CQRS).\r\n4. Batch sequential & pipeline architectures:  Big data processing (Hadoop, Spark), Map-Reduce, Tensorflow and other machine learning graph-based functional transformation.\r\n5. Devops infrastructure.  Version control everything (append-only).  So-called \"immutable\" and \"idempotent\" infrastructure set up by running code, not by Linux admins.\r\n\r\n## Reactive programming\r\n1. What is it?  Evolution of Observer pattern.  Observable = Observer pattern plus onError and onCompletion.  Hot and cold streams.\r\n2. Use in UI architectures.  Strong competitor to Model-View-Controller and sibling patterns.  \r\n\r\n## What you will learn in this talk\r\nThe amount of innovation and hype in web technologies is intense and often overwhelming.  If you haven't been staying current, this talk should give you a mental map to start your learning.  If you have stayed current, this talk should reveal how functional ideas weave throughout modern web architectures and perhaps provide insight into why they work.\r\n\r\nThe talk surveys how modern web systems are built with FP patterns.  It will dig into one client-side example and show how FP ideas can simplify this task.","notes":"I propose this as a 30-minute tech talk.  I can scale the material to fit into 22 mins + questions.\r\n\r\nI have plenty of material so I'm happy to do a 90-minute tech talk that digs into more details if you think the topic is sufficiently interesting.  90-minute slots are rare at SATURN, so I don't want to presume.  \r\n\r\nIf you think 90 minutes is better than 30, please consider this as a participatory session.  If the audience is really new to FP ideas, it can take time to see how to accomplish work using these patterns.  There is a great game we could play a few rounds of ([Cube Composer](http://david-peter.de/cube-composer)) to warm them up (go ahead and try it now).  Then we could design a system using event queues and discuss the quality attribute tradeoffs, or go further into the UI reactive example.","abstract":"Functional programming (FP) has invaded architectures.

I have a few suggestions/comments from the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program: \r\n\r\n1. One may look at the description and ask: 'Sounds promising. But we use scrum/agile development in a low ceremony way. Would this work for me?'  So, is this approach applicable to Agile development? With small co-located teams and short sprints? \r\n\r\n2. If I had to guess, I'd say that profiling the jobs and pains of the customers takes time and requires some modeling and documentation effort. My feeling from experience is that developers will not be very keen on doing that. How much automation can be employed in this process? How long does it take? Is it hours in facilitated meeting with stakeholders like in  QAW or ATAM?\r\n\r\n3. I see the value of the approach for companies that sell software products or products with software. Would it be equally attractive to enterprise IT? I work in enterprise IT for the government in an environment where this statement is not very appealing: \"build a plan that our sales and business colleagues understand\". \r\n\r\n(In the Notes you can use a blank line to make PaperCall render separate paragraphs.)\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-30T12:04:06.980Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T12:04:06.980Z"},{"id":3841,"submission_id":8078,"talk_id":15347,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Paulo,\r\nThank you for taking the time to write feedback! Let me give a short reply to your comments.\r\n\r\n1. It could very much be applicable, the products I used this on have only a handful of developers. As written it can help decide what to do first during sprint planning. It would mostly be a tool for the product owner/architect though. SATURN is also an architecture conference, so some planning effort should be ok.\r\n\r\n2. With three-four people knowledgeable about our business it took half a day to profile two customer groups in sufficient depth. Strategyzer very much encourages quick and iterative development of products. The methodology builds on posters with sticky notes and a whiteboard, tools I believe are popular in Agile teams.\r\n\r\n3. I work both with products and enterprise IT, so I believe I understand your concern. Yet enterprise IT also has customers, the business. Business users also have jobs that they try to accomplish for our company. Business decision makers are economic decision makers and thereby a customer that wants something done efficiently.

There has since been quite a bit of buzz around 'Serverless' development, with entire frameworks and tooling built to support such an approach. This talk is intended to discuss what the tradeoffs of taking such an approach are, how to technically execute on such an approach within AWS, and what my own experiences have been in building and running Serverless applications in production.","notes":"90 minutes\r\n\r\nAs the backend tech lead at Stanley Black and Decker I have led the development and deployment of multiple applications into production that rely entirely on Serverless backends, along with a hybrid legacy app that we are currently moving toward being Serverless. \r\n\r\nI intend to cover the basics of building REST interfaces on top of the AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda, delve into the tradeoffs of doing so, and then branch out into methods and considerations of data storage, access control (including authorization/authentication of users to your REST endpoints and other resources), continuous integration and development, messaging patterns (both solely on the backend, and between the backend and various user clients), backend generated events and triggers (i.e., responding to scheduled events, or building in logic to trigger additional behaviors outside of the context of a user request), and various best practices and considerations I've learned from my experiences.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this talk I will touch on the place of the following AWS services in a Serverless solution - Lambda, API Gateway, S3, Dynamo, RDS, Elasticache, IAM, Cognito, STS, SQS, SNS, IoT, CloudFormations, Cloudfront, Route 53.\r\n\r\nThe intended presentation mechanism is predominantly slides, with links to code and Cloudformations to illustrate less obvious implementation strategies  (i.e., not \"here's how to write a record to DynamoDB\", which is easily gleaned from API documents, but \"here's code demonstrating the usage of the AWS IoT platform as a websocket for sending arbitrary messages across\", or \"here's an example Cloudformation for setting up an existing lambda to execute periodically, and to include a dead letter queue to report errors to\". In general, my goal is not to give an end to end working example of everything I discuss (as that will be impossible to go over in detail in the time frame, and will be exceptionally contrived), but instead to go over enough to give people a high degree of confidence in speccing out their own projects, while also providing code or walk through an example for anything that did not strike me as inherently obvious on how to implement from glancing at AWS' documentation. \r\n\r\nTentative high level outline - \r\n\r\n1. API Gateway and Lambda - demonstrate a Serverless endpoint, wherein we can see arbitrary code execution in response to an HTTP POST, in the context of a Lambda, which simply parrots back the body and one or two headers, to show how they can be mapped into the function. Discuss using the API Gateway as a passthrough to an existing REST API, to allow for the swapping out, endpoint by endpoint, to a serverless one, in the event of a legacy app.\r\n\r\n2. Data storage options - largely high level discussion of considerations between Elasticache, DynamoDB, and S3 as storage mechanisms, in terms of cost, ease of use, and availability/consistency guarantees.\r\n\r\n3. Backend processing and user notification - Discuss lambda event sources and their implications (the ability to trigger lambdas from writes to Dynamo or S3, a brief foray into SQS as a distributed queue, and how things can fail, and what to do about them). Demonstrate using AWS IoT for websocket pushes to web clients (and mention GCM and APNS as still being available for pushing to mobile). Discuss SNS as an option to broadcast events to custom HTTP endpoints, or to send emails, as well as a possible way to send mobile push messages.\r\n\r\n4. Access Control - Discuss Cognito as an Amazon provided identity provider. Demonstrate how to go from a Cognito identity (or a custom identity, if using custom code to log someone in) to a set of temporary AWS credentials, that can be used to access resources. A brief foray into IAM policies (which control what a set of AWS credentials have access to). And how to leverage both IAM and AWS credentials to properly secure one's own REST API endpoints.\r\n\r\n5. CI/CD - Discuss some of the frameworks for developing and deploying serverless code to AWS. Demonstrate an example using the Serverless (http://www.serverless.com/) framework. Demonstrate Cloudformations as a way to define and port infrastructure between environments. Suggest the use of AWS Config and Cloudtrail to track changes. \r\n\r\n6. Monitoring - Dive into Cloudwatch. Demonstrate executing lambdas, navigating the resulting logs, exporting to S3 for ingesting into another tool. Demonstrate available metrics, and how to set up alarms. Discuss integration points with tools we've used.\r\n\r\n7. Latency and Cloudfront- Discuss latency of lambdas. How real it is, how to mitigate it, when to cache. Demonstrate setting up a Cloudfront instance in front of custom API, and when to use it vs the API Gateway's cache. \r\n\r\n","abstract":"This talk is to introduce Serverless computing, a new paradigm in the cloud for deploying applications that requires no server administration, and which scales transparently in both function and cost.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. The first sentence of the description implicates a causal relation that I believe doesn't exist (\"With the release of AWS Lambda and API Gateway, it has become possible to build RESTful interfaces without any server infrastructure in the cloud\").  One can build REST interfaces for enterprise systems on-premises for the intranet, without AWS Lambda or API Gateway. In any case, if you're using AWS Lambda, I think you *are* using cloud infrastructure, you just don't need to procure/manage/be aware of the servers.  \r\n\r\n2. In the notes you say \"I intend to cover the basics of building REST interfaces.\" Do you mean REST API design? That's a quite large topic on its own.  \r\n\r\n3. In addition to benefits, I think you should also discuss the challenges and drawbacks of serverless architecture. Such discussion flows naturally into motivation for and risks associated with serverless. \r\n\r\n4. A 90-minute long talk takes the time equivalent to 3 30-minute talks, so the info should be clearly valuable. Serverless is a hot topic this year and many people want to know what it is, if it's a good fit for them, what's the roadmap to 'go serverless'. I think your talk goes over all of that. Do you intend to talk about serverless outside AWS? For example, simple use of MBaaS for mobile app authentication?  \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6. What is \"event pipelining\"? Is there a more commonly used equivalent term? Maybe a term that's in wikipedia?  :^)\r\n\r\n7. Just to clarify, what's the presentation mechanics? Slide-based presentation end-to-end? Or do you plan  to have a demo? Or is it a tutorial where participants will actually use their laptops to play with the technology? \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T19:04:36.959Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T19:04:36.959Z"},{"id":3757,"submission_id":8090,"talk_id":15375,"user":{"name":"Christopher Phillips","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ee258f073df1844949be0ce18d5926dd?s=500","email":"lostcolony@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks so much for your input!

My intention was to focus on AWS; as part of that, I intended to discuss Cognito, AWS' mobile identity provider, along with how it provides STS tokens, themselves associated with IAM roles, and how those are used across AWS to access services directly, and can also be used to control access to individual API endpoints.

This is different from the well-known [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) (Implemented for C++ in [[1]](https://github.com/actor-framework) and [[2]](http://www.theron-library.com/index.php)), which uses private state and peer-to-peer messaging, and is closer in spirit to the [Flux application architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview.html#content) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), with its single dispatcher and its unidirectional data flow.\r\n\r\nOur data model is suitable for high performance and complicated algorithmic flows, where multiple threads require access to shared objects. We have implemented it in C++, and used it successfully as the application framework for the [iTero intra-oral Scanner](http://www.itero.com/en) (See demos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_kYPyjUtbU) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWuNPt33tho))\r\n\r\n###Our architecture is based on the following principles:\r\n\r\n1. All shared state is immutable and reference-counted\r\n1. Each actor keeps a lightweight snapshot of the state, which consists of references to shared immutable objects\r\n1. Actor snapshots are eventually consistent\r\n1. Actors communicate using [Publish-Subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)\r\n1. A single dispatch function is used for publishing both events and data updates\r\n1. Persistence, replay, undo and application logging are handled by generic mechanisms\r\n1.

After 15 years of leading algorithms teams, I decided 4 years ago to become a software architect. Since then, I got a Software Architecture Professional Certification from SEI, and I have been constantly studying and teaching various domains of software engineering.\r\n\r\nI am highly passionate about software architecture, and I love teaching software engineering and mentoring developers, as well as coding in multiple programming languages.

Present the challenge we faced\r\n  - Show video and give a description of the [iTero intra-oral Scanner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdI5Pp2dVTg)\r\n  - Explain the data model we use in earlier versions of iTero, and why it was inadequate for the new product\r\n 1. Present the basics of the architecture\r\n  - Define an \"Actor\"\r\n  - Explain how actors access data and communicate via a dispatcher: All of the shared state is made of immutable data, and any modification is done by creating a new object, and broadcasting it\r\n  - Explain the data model (each actor keeps a key-value dictionary, where the key-space is shared, and the values are pointers to reference-counted objects in the heap)\r\n  - Explain about publish-subscribe and event handlers\r\n 1. Explain how this architecture is different from the famous Actors Model\r\n  - Provide links to existing implementations [1](https://github.com/actor-framework), [2](http://www.theron-library.com/index.php).\r\n  - Explain how our model is based on shared state and publish-subscribe, while the Actors model is using private state and peer-to-peer messaging.\r\n 1. Discuss more aspects of the architecture\r\n  - Separation of concerns: Actors are responsible for message-passing and fetching data from the shared state, and they delegate computations to other objects that are tested in isolation\r\n  - How an actor is created: the role of the dispatcher in making sure that a newly created actor has access to the most up-to-date state\r\n  - A generic solution for persistence\r\n  - Cancellation of long-running operations\r\n  - Generic logging\r\n  - A generic Record/Replay feature\r\n 1. Discuss design trade-offs, and pros & cons of the architecture\r\n  - Pros: Safe concurrency, and ease of implementing complex logic\r\n  - Cons: Data model is flattened into a key-value dictionary, losing a natural hierarchy\r\n 1. Shortly discuss a possible improvement of the data model\r\n  - Use a persistent tree structure (as in [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)), instead of a flat key-value store, to restore the natural hierarchy of objects.","abstract":"We present a battle-proven architecture for lock-free concurrency control in multi-threaded C++ applications.

This requires multiple threads to access large amounts of shared data for generating scans, refining them, repositioning them, rendering them and storing them to persistent storage - all simultaneously. This is why we chose to design a system where shared state can be accessed safely by collaborating threads. Pub-Sub was chosen because of the high complexity and the data-driven nature of the design (e.g. rendering is triggered when an object is changed, without the producer of the object having to communicate with the rendering actor; denoising and filtering algorithms are triggered when a new scan is created; etc...). Do you think this clarifies the motivation?\r\n\r\nIn answer to your comment about sections 4 & 5, I think I'll tighten this discussion by removing a couple of items from section 4 (the first two, probably), and incorporating the rest of them into the trade-offs discussion, showing how these aspects are added benefits: For example, the pub-sub nature, together with the dispatcher, enables a generic record/replay feature (like in Redux), and similarly, generic solutions for persistence and logging.\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees be able to do that they couldn't do before? They will be able to implement a data model that supports efficient and safe sharing of memory in a multi-threaded application. This is useful for complex systems. Also, they will learn the benefits of channeling all writes through a single thread (dispatcher), which provides total ordering of messages, and is one way of ensuring consistency in concurrent systems.\r\n\r\nWIth kind regards,\r\n\r\nAdi.","created_at":"2017-02-06T06:43:08.489Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T06:43:08.489Z"}]}},{"id":7302,"submission":{"id":7302,"state":"accepted","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2016-12-24T11:51:28.259Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T22:30:45.175Z","additional_info":"I have plenty of speaking experience, but, unfortunately, no video.","rating":100.0,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["communication","leadership","influence"],"profile":{"name":"Adi Levin","bio":"I'm a software developer, architect and mathematician.

I have lots of experience in algorithm design and implementation in the fields of Computer Aided Design; 3D computations, surface reconstruction and design; 2D and 3D shape matching; Optimization methods; CNC Tool-path planning; Image processing and computer vision.\r\n\r\nI've managed small teams (up to 4 people) for over 20 years, and have successful experience working in a global organization with multiple remote teams, as a technical leader.\r\n\r\nAs a software architect, I enjoy the close collaboration with developers, coaching them, designing software and presenting the designs, and taking part in the implementation. I know from my own experience that character and interpersonal relationships are key factors to the success of an architect, and I am constantly growing in these aspects as well.","twitter":"","company":"Align Technology","url":"https://il.linkedin.com/in/adi-levin-0a0a614","shirt_size":"Men's L","email":"adi.4694252@gmail.com","location":"Israel"},"talk":{"title":"How to gain influence as a software architect","description":"The best software architects combine strong creative and analytical skills, with the character traits of a leader. An architect needs to form collaborations with different teams, often with different styles of working and planning, in order to clarify the project's scope and requirements, and then design the architecture and implement it.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, an architect needs to use all communication tools effectively: Meetings, architecture drawings, written documentation, design reviews, code reviews and informal conversations. In every opportunity, an architect should encourage the engagement of other stakeholders and must learn how to deal effectively with their concerns, and, in particular, how to deal with opposition and with conflict.\r\n\r\nBut communication techniques and technical excellence combined are not sufficient for sustainable effective leadership. To gain trust and credibility, one has to display consistent personal values and character ethics, and build relationships that are based on integrity and commitment.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share with you my own experiences and lessons learned from years of working as a software architect in a global organization, and from studying dozens of the greatest writings from the field of business, leadership and communication.","notes":"##Primary track\r\n\r\nI propose this talk for the track **\"Other topics of interest\"**, since the lessons learned here are applicable to a wide range of circumstances, and are not related to any technology or software trend.\r\n\r\n##Session type\r\n\r\nThis talk falls into the category of **\"Experience Report Presentation\"** (30 minutes, describing first-hand experiences and lessons learned). It is entirely based on my own experience, and the lessons I have learned in the past 4 years working in a global organization, gaining the trust and cooperation of stakeholders of all kinds.\r\n\r\n##About me\r\n\r\nI have a Ph.D. in mathematics and plenty of experience giving lectures. I have given 14 talks in international math conferences, including 2 Siggraph talks ([Siggraph 2006](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1141990), [Siggraph 1999](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=311541)). After 15 years of leading algorithms teams, I decided to become a software architect, 4 years ago. Since then, I got a Software Architecture Professional Certification from SEI, and I have been constantly studying and teaching various domains of software engineering. In addition, I have spent numerous hours studying the literature on leadership, personal growth, effective communication and influence, and I have successfully applied the techniques and principles to my work.\r\n\r\nThis will be my first talk in an international conference on software architecture. I created this talk after years of successful technical leadership in a global organization, gaining credibility with many people from remote locations and from various disciplines, in domains where I was often not an expert.\r\n\r\nI am also the submitter of a second talk, with the title **High-Performance Multi-Threaded Immutable Store for C++**.\r\n\r\n##Main theme\r\n\r\n***Collaboration is power; Be genuinely interested in the concerns and challenges of others; Include them generously; Act with integrity***\r\n\r\nAll of the stories, insights, and tips that I share have the above theme in common. For example: When talking about effective online meetings, I share how useful it is to reflect people's concerns in writing and in real-time, as a way to verify that their concerns are understood correctly, and to give them the feeling that they have been heard; When naming components, I recommend to include others in choosing their names, as a way to encourage their collaboration; For dealing with opposition, I recommend to focus on a better understanding of the opposing party; On dealing with difficulties, I emphasize that this is the time to make extra efforts and display personal integrity, by being there for the developers, and by admitting and correcting one's own mistakes.\r\n\r\nWhile those messages are all relevant to any leadership situation, I believe they are especially useful for software architects, whose effectiveness relies upon their ability to form a collaboration, often without the benefit of a position of authority.\r\n\r\n##Talk outline\r\n\r\nThe talk will be filled with personal stories and examples from my own experience. The audience will be given a set of techniques that anyone can implement and principles that anyone can follow.\r\n\r\n1. Challenges facing a software architect (based on my own experience):\r\n  * Remote teams\r\n  * Some teams not communicating well with one another\r\n  * Teams not used to working with a designated software architect\r\n  * Stakeholders from very different time zones\r\n  * Different cultures of different teams; different levels of agility\r\n  * Poorly documented legacy systems that need to evolve\r\n  * Different opinions about whether to build or to buy\r\n  * Unclear project scope\r\n  * Unclear requirements\r\n  * Stakeholders with prior commitments, who don’t have time to spend on your project\r\n  * Tasks that require designing a kind of system that you have never designed before\r\n1. How to recognize that you have influence?\r\n  * Your designs come to life\r\n  * People ask for your advice on various projects outside your area of responsibility\r\n  * People want you to help them resolve disagreements\r\n  * People tend to accept what you propose\r\n  * People are copying your documentation style\r\n  * People welcome your participation in meetings on any topic\r\n1. Effective meetings (especially remote meetings)\r\n  * Different kinds of meetings require smaller or larger groups\r\n  * Declare the goal of a meeting\r\n  * Publish agenda and slides up-front\r\n  * Phrase questions to be answered during the meeting\r\n  * Capture people's comments and opinions in writing and display in real-time them during the meeting\r\n  * Finish in time, and share meeting notes with people\r\n1. Effective architecture views to bring out the essence of an architecture\r\n  * Depending on the audience, it is often better to present a simple and concise drawing, as opposed to complete sets of architecture views\r\n  * Define names of components/modules/classes and their responsibilities. The other things follow from that. \r\n  * Naming something is an act of leadership. Declaring the name that someone else chose is even stronger. \r\n1. Use written documentation - this is especially important in a big and global organization\r\n  * Writing is hard for people, so there’s an opportunity to stand out here\r\n  * Make information accessible\r\n  * Become the source of information by summarizing it better than others do\r\n1. Encourage the engagement of others\r\n  * Seek the subject matter experts and do 1:1 discussions with them\r\n  * Look for opportunities to incorporate the ideas of others. If you accept someone’s idea, they will be more understanding next time you reject one of their ideas. \r\n  * Look for opportunities to show honest appreciation to other people’s contribution\r\n1. Dealing with opposition, rejections and unknowns\r\n  * If someone opposes an idea, ask questions about it - don’t just insist - regardless of how strongly you feel about your solution\r\n  * Never get attached to a design. Recognize that there are multiple solutions and analyze both the benefits and the cost of any design decision\r\n  * Seek first to understand, and only then to be understood \r\n  * When it is not clear how to make progress, phrase specific questions to be answered and ask for people's help\r\n1. Build personal relationships with stakeholders\r\n  * Get to know people on a personal level\r\n  * Seek opportunities to show your appreciation\r\n1. Be there for developers, after handing off the design to them\r\n  * There will be unanswered questions and difficulties\r\n  * Be there in weekly meetings and sprint planning\r\n  * Notice the conversations between teams, and help where it's needed\r\n1. References to literature\r\n  * [5 levels of leadership by John C Maxwell](https://www.amazon.com/Levels-Leadership-Proven-Maximize-Potential/dp/B005SA65DI)\r\n  * [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People)\r\n  * [How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People)\r\n  * [Benjamin Franklin's autobiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_Benjamin_Franklin)","abstract":"The success of a software architect relies on his/her ability to influence development teams and decision makers and to gain trust with other stakeholders.

If you need to shorten the presentation, I suggest dropping or shortening topics 1, 3, and 8. \r\n\r\nThis sentence is not OK to me: \"Depending on the audience, it is often better to present a simple and concise drawing, as opposed to complete sets of architecture views.\"  Here's how I think (based on \"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition\"): \r\n- a software architecture is described as a set of architecture views. There isn't a single diagram that shows everything.\r\n- you should only create an architecture view if it has clear value to stakeholders (the audience for the software architecture).\r\n- a given architecture view may consist of a simple and concise drawing. \r\n\r\nThe following sentence is not clear to me: \"Declaring the name that someone else chose is even stronger.\"\r\n\r\nIn the talk outline, item (4) recommends: \"Define names of components/modules/classes and their responsibilities. The other things follow from that.\"\r\nI think having expressive names for software elements is important, but that recommendation alone is not very helpful. In fact, item (4) is about effective architecture views and there are so many important recommendations under this topic, such as:\r\n- Use a notation key in your diagrams (or indicate what standard notation you're using).\r\n- Use different symbols for different types of elements and relations. \r\n- Use consistent symbology across diagrams. \r\n- If you're using a pattern in your design, name it. If the reader is familiar with the pattern, he/she will understand the design more easily.\r\n- Use a template (standard organization) for your documentation. In particular, use the same template for all architecture views. (Subsections in a template may be N/A of course.)\r\n- Keep the information up-to-date. If you can't update the documentation, discard, archive or mark it as out-of-date.\r\n- Complement structural diagrams (e.g., UML class diagram) with behavior diagrams (e.g., UML sequence diagram).\r\n- Record the rationale for important design decisions.\r\n- Avoid ambiguity; write from the reader's point of view; review the documentation. \r\nThese recommendations can be found in the book I mentioned above (\"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition\").\r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n- Notes: \"trust and cooperation of *of* stakeholders\"\r\n- Notes: \"Capture people’s comments *opinions* in writing \"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-04T18:57:06.728Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T18:57:06.728Z"},{"id":3090,"submission_id":7302,"talk_id":13936,"user":{"name":"Adi Levin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1cc0aaebe6a196f253e61d0454edf59?s=500","email":"adi.4694252@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks for the thorough review, Paulo. I am going to use it to improve the presentation, and I am taking this opportunity to clarify my proposal.\r\n\r\nMy emphasis in this presentation will be on the human relations aspects and how they affect the level of influence of a software architect. \r\n\r\nYour comments about the architectural views are correct, and I should rephrase my intent: All of the architectural views are important for reasoning about a system's structure. I am not presenting a different theory of documenting software architecture, but I am commenting about the way in which I would present those architectural views to different stakeholders. In presentations, we often don't have time to go through all of the views; also, we may do it in a more constrained environment of online remote meetings, so we need to focus on the things that yield the most understanding and buy-in from the stakeholders. \r\n\r\nIn this context, I claim that naming and stating the responsibilities of a component or a module, is of especially high value.  The list of responsibilities is a concise representation of the intent of the designer, which helps stakeholders review the architecture and ask good questions about it (e.g. \"if this component is only responsible for X, then how come it depends on Y\"?).\r\n\r\nOne way to make the most out of architectural discussions is to find opportunities where other people contribute. A very powerful application of this is when we name software elements. By asking someone else: \"How would you name this component?\" and accepting the name that they offer, we make them our partners in the project. Similarly, if someone proposes a modification and we accept it, we gain more of their their cooperation, and it will be wise to give credit to the contributors. \r\n\r\nMy plan is to share other insights of this kind. This complements the more technical aspects of analysis, design and documentation, with wisdom that comes from the realm of leadership, effective communication and personal growth, and I have lots of relevant stories from my personal experience, which I think will be highly beneficial to the audience.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I will need to shorten some of the topics - and I will shorten topics 1 & 3, as your proposed. As for topic #8, this is one I would like to emphasize, because my main point is how personal relationships make a difference.\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\n\r\nAdi.","created_at":"2017-01-05T13:46:42.669Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T13:46:42.669Z"},{"id":3091,"submission_id":7302,"talk_id":13936,"user":{"name":"Adi Levin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1cc0aaebe6a196f253e61d0454edf59?s=500","email":"adi.4694252@gmail.com"},"body":"Paulo - I also fixed the two typos you indicated.

Thanks for the kind words and for your review.\r\n\r\nHere is my context: I have been leading, and am still leading the technical design of a number of projects:\r\n\r\n1. An application for a 3D intra-oral scanner (http://www.itero.com/en) - there were ~20 developers working on it, divided to 4 teams in two locations (Israel and Moscow). Made of C++, C#, high performance algorithms and 3D graphics, interacting with proprietary hardware and real-time components.\r\n\r\n2. A HIPAA-compliant, scalable and highly available cloud-based storage system distributed in multiple data centers with integrations to ~10 applications. Involves ~6 development teams from 4 locations (East coast, West coast, Israel and Moscow), and other stakeholders from 3 more locations. Made of Java, NoSQL database, public cloud storage, REST API, caching layers, custom replication and workflow management, and a challenging data migration and transition strategy.\r\n\r\n3. A scalable and highly available cloud-based architecture for enhancing web applications by server-side algorithms, with interactive-rate messaging between the web page and the dedicated server-side process. Involves 3 teams from 2 locations + stakeholders from 2 more locations. Made of Java, Websocket, REST, elastic cloud-based cluster, with fully automated deployments.\r\n\r\n4. (Currently in early stages:) A cloud-based service for capturing, storing, displaying and manipulating doctor prescriptions. Emphasizes modifiability. Made of React, Java REST API, and document-oriented DB in the cloud.\r\n\r\nI am also involved in multiple other projects related to identity management & authentication, cloud-based workflow management, storage, data analytics, cluster computations, and others.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nRegarding your main feedback: You're right - my presentation should focus on a few key messages. I think those will be:\r\n\r\n1) Ways to get other people more engaged - this includes effective meetings, especially long-distance on-line conference calls, in which I have plenty of experience and success. For example, I want to demonstrate how I capture and display people's comments in real-time, and how satisfying this is to the participants: They know they are understood, and they know their opinion is heard, even when it is not accepted; Another example is getting people involved in the early stages of giving names to components.\r\n\r\n2) Ways to deal with difficulty and opposition: being open to others' ideas; listening, and truly caring about the concerns of others; not being attached to a specific solution, and being ready to challenge your own ideas; This doesn't mean giving up on good design solutions: It means that you should be willing to explain both the advantages and the trade-offs in the design, not in order to defend it at all cost, but in order to truly search for the best solution, thereby laying the foundation for better collaboration in the future, regardless of whose opinion ends up being accepted.\r\n\r\n3) Building long-term credibility. \"They don't care how much you know until they know how much you care\" - show commitment by being there when things are not clear, by allocating time for review and demo sessions; by providing specific feedback on detailed design decisions; by being there when teams disagree and need someone to resolve the dispute; by showing the appreciation and giving credit generously to others; And by admitting and correcting your design mistakes as soon as those come up.\r\n\r\nI will also give useful references to literature, where people can learn more about influence & leadership.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOn a personal note: I attended Saturn 3 years ago. It was one of the best conferences I have ever attended, and I still remember some of the great presentations (Especially the keynotes by Dianne Marsh and Joe Justice; The course by Robert Wojcik; Scott Hanselman's great talk; And others...). I will be honored and deeply excited to be among this excellent group of speakers.\r\n\r\nThis talk is not finalized yet. I have so many stories and references to share.

This presentation suggests a simple process you can follow to perform a rapid assessment of any software architecture effort regardless of its size, complexity or stage of development. The focus is on capturing the most critical aspects of the software architecture including: (a) Software Quality Attributes; (b) Key Architectural Decisions (including hardware platforms, software technology, development tools and reuse strategy); and (c) Architectural Design (primarily in the form of Unified Modeling Language or UML). Emphasis is placed on identifying and documenting references to existing artifacts. It generally requires an interview with the most knowledgeable software engineer on the proposal, development or maintenance team to identify the location of artifacts that are available and information that has never been documented. This is basically a two-day process. On the first day information is gathered and quickly recorded. On the second day, the information is analyzed, expert opinion(s) formulated, and a report is prepared and disseminated to all of the relevant Stakeholders.

Growing an Architect's Community - My Journey","description":"Passionate individuals and businesses both try to create successful Communities of Practice (CoPs) for myriad reasons from honest desire to networking to a financially driven goal of sharpening worker skills. Why do some well-funded effort fail while rag-tag start-ups succeed?  In this session, hear the story of my struggles and successes  to grow a networked community of architects that now stretches across the globe.   There is no single formula to creating a successful community.  If you've got passion and take the time to really ask \"Why?\", your journey is starting off on the right foot!   Choose vision driven techniques over old-school mechanics to jumpstart new groups or resurrect ailing ones.  Attendees will talk away energized and ready to try a few of the techniques that worked  including:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sowing the seeds – Organic communities, whether jump started by a corporation or a hobbyist, tend to have the greatest growth and staying power.  How and where to sow community seeds positions a community for possible success.\r\n</li>\r\n<li> What are the success attributes of a boom? – How to define success and using qualitative and quantitative measures to detect a bust.</li>\r\n<li>Value, Brand, and Localization – Communities thrive when there is ownership at all levels and pride.  Understand how value definition impact a community’s charter and how building a brand provides community members with a sense of empowerment and worth.</li>\r\n<li>Agile concepts for community leadership – Transparency, communication, and continual evaluation/reprioritization of next steps can situate community leaders to react nimbly to change and protect community health.</li>\r\n</ul>","notes":"When I joined Deloitte Consulting, there was a rag-tag group occasionally sending out an email newsletter that went straight into everyone's trash.  I've taken that community of less that 40 to nearly 500 globally.  While this could easily be a 30 minute session or longer, I want to energize my peers at SATURN to rethink how they are caring for and feeding their architects.  I've won multiple national and global awards from Deloitte around my community building approaches.  Interestingly, the journey includes needing to pivot and find ways to engage those smart millennials.   Learning Outcomes: Participants will walk away energized with ideas for organizing and nurturing successful architecture communities:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Techniques to sowing organic growth </li>\r\n<li>How to defining success attributes and what are associated measurement techniques</li>\r\n<li>The impact of top-down support versus and bottom-up drive </li>\r\n<li>Principles for defining value and brand for a community; understand the impact of localization on a community or chapter</li>\r\n<li>Suggestions on applying agile techniques at the leadership level</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n","abstract":"Growing a community is tougher than it looks!

The involved systems fulfill valid purposes in their own right, can operate separately and are managed for their own purpose rather than the purposes of the whole.\r\n\r\nAllocation of business functions to specific system components and definition of interfaces with significant consequences for architecture of such large and complex IT and software system-of-systems (SoS) is a challenge. It requires data supporting decision criteria and accommodating fast evolution of the architecture in the agile organization.  \r\n\r\nRoche Customized Method of Architecting SoS \r\n===========================================\r\n\r\nFor the architecting of the system-of-systems in Roche product context a customized method was defined based on the US Department of Defense Architecture Framework.\r\n\r\nThis method involves 6 steps with start/finish criteria and deliverables for each. I will illustrate these steps using examples from Roche.\r\n\r\n1.  Business process Domain Analysis (identification of Business Drivers, Business Capabilities, Business Functions, Constraints, elaboration of User Stories and Workflows, definition of Quality Attributes).\r\n\r\n2.  Integrated Dynamic Modeling (IDM) for multiple workflows within the business process.\r\n\r\n3.  Derivation of Events, Activities and Resources for each workflow IDM.\r\n\r\n4.  Alignment to elaborate Common Events, Common Activities and Common Resources for all modelled workflows.\r\n\r\n5.  Identification of existing/overlapping/missing functionality (based on Activities) and data and processors (based on Resources) in involved systems. Preliminary allocation of the functions to the systems and verification of fulfillment of Business Criteria (based on Domain Analysis).\r\n\r\n6.  Architecting of data, process, deployment, … models and preliminary design of interface between the involved systems.  Verification of Quality Attributes fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThis method can be applied in agile projects, if the sprints are oriented on implementation of workflow.\r\n\r\nResults of application of the method at Roche\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\nThe customized method for the architecting of system-of-systems was applied to business processes related to Remote Solutions and IoT. It led to quick definition of models and derived data supporting the decision making and allocation of business functions and resources to existing and to be developed systems as well as identification of common resources and interfaces for their exchange. \r\n\r\n","notes":"As author of this method and part of the team applying it in the real world large scale projects I can give the practitioners view and probably answer most of questions. \r\nMy talk at the SATURN 2016 related to multiple ATAMs gave a short introduction to a small subset of the entire system.","abstract":"Customized method for making architecture decisions of allocation business functions to specific components of the system-of-systems and definition of interfaces for large and complex IT and software.  \nThis method of 6 steps with start/finish criteria for each was successfully applied at Roche.","audience_level":"All","talk_format":"Experience Report Presentation (30 minutes)"},"ratings":[{"id":27470,"submission_id":7950,"value":100,"comments":"","created_at":"2017-01-30T12:38:56.192Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T12:38:56.192Z","user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"}},{"id":27214,"submission_id":7950,"value":100,"comments":"I like that he's introducing the method (whose components won't be new to SATURN audience) and the real business application.

I have a few suggestions/comments from the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program: \r\n\r\n1. You say \"million connection points\" to characterize a large scale system. Would there be a different metrics unit people are more familiar with? LOC maybe? \r\n\r\n2. I hope you use examples to explain each of the steps. In fact, if you do so, I think you should say that in the description, that is, say something like... \"using real-life examples, I'll explain the 6 steps...\"\r\n\r\n3. One may look at the description and ask: 'Sounds promising. But we use scrum/agile development in a low ceremony way. Would this work for me?'  So, is this approach applicable to Agile development? With a small co-located team working on a single system and doing short sprints? If not, that's ok. If you see value, you may want to mention that in the description.\r\n\r\n3. If I had to guess, I'd say that some of these steps take time and require significant modeling and documentation effort. My feeling from experience is that developers will not be very keen on doing that. How much automation can be employed in the process? How long does it take? Is it hours in facilitated meetings with stakeholders like in QAW or ATAM?  Maybe the description can say something about the feasibility and cost required to use the process. \r\n\r\n4. The second paragraph is one long sentence. If you break it up it gets easier to parse.\r\n\r\n5. Just terminology: what you describe in step 1 as business process domain analysis seems to focus on functionality. To me that's business process modeling. To me domain analysis would necessarily encompass definition of business entities. An example of technique for domain analysis would be Eric Evans' DDD.  \r\n\r\n6. By the way, how are business capabilities different from business functions? If they're close enough, you can remove one to make the talk description shorter. \r\n\r\n\r\nTypo: \"and derived data*,* supporting the decision making ** and allocation \"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-30T12:37:09.362Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T12:37:09.362Z"},{"id":3932,"submission_id":7950,"talk_id":15115,"user":{"name":"Andrzej Knafel, Ph.D.","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ad6ad0b2d3de9e777d1f16d79c14132c?s=500","email":"andrzej.knafel@roche.com"},"body":"Hi Paulo\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your comments.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. I work in enterprise IT. In our organization, all new IT software projects now use microservices and docker, but more than half of the developers have not yet created anything in this new world. Many organizations are in a similar situation. I hope in your talk you make a reflection about what are the benefits of moving to microservices and containers, and what are the challenges and risks. Talks on this topic typically emphasize the good things, but often neglect to mention the difficulties. \r\n\r\n2. One of the topics is \"Tips for integrating containers into complex existing environments, supporting the hybrid state of microservices and monolithic applications.\" I hope you explain what would be the motivation and criteria to move existing complex monolithic application to containers. We have for the moment discarded that option in our organization because of cost and complexity. We have found it useful at times to take cuts of a monolith and repackage as containerized microservices that expose http endpoints though.\r\n\r\n3. Minor point... Your last topic is \"Putting an end to Shadow-IT.\"  Here's what wikipedia says about shadow IT: \"Shadow IT is a term often used to describe information-technology systems and solutions built and used inside organizations without explicit organizational approval. It is also used, along with the term 'Stealth IT', to describe solutions specified and deployed by departments other than the IT department.\" So, people using gmail instead of the corporate email system is \"shadow IT\", and I see how that's a problem. But it seems this derogatory term also applies to software applications developed by non-IT groups. Well, I think that's a great idea if put forth with some direction. My organization has had for years a successful program for decentralized software application development. Many end users now develop great solutions, and are given access to IT-managed databases when needed.  \r\n\r\n4. The term visibility is not clear to me in \"while ensuring visibility, security, governance and compliance\".\r\n\r\nTypo: \"recommended t*o*pologies and patterns\".\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T14:21:15.541Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T14:21:15.541Z"}]}},{"id":8029,"submission":{"id":8029,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-14T01:22:59.118Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:47:28.004Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":90.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["30-minute-talk","micro services architecture"],"profile":{"name":"Sairam Tadigadapa","bio":"\r\n\r\nI am a Director of Software Engineering at Capital One.

My focus in on Marketing and Decisioning Technologies. I am in their Richmond, VA location.  I lead a team of 70 engineers developing architecture, building APIs and devops platforms. Over the last couple of years we built several mission critical APIs most of them are for customer facing and highly regulated capabilities. We learnt a lot breaking a monolithic application into micro services. I led delivery of several enterprise APIs and deployed into production. Hope to share my experiences in the session. I will also have some time for questions and answers at the end. The talk should last for 30 min.\r\nI will be explaining the following success factors and considerations\r\n\r\nWhy did we go with micro services?\r\n\r\nThe initiative that I led was a regulatory project for Know Your Customer (KYC) regulation. It has very tight timelines and dependencies across the organization. The best way we could have accomplished the timelines is to go with a microservices architecture. So the business drivers for microservices architecture are\r\n\r\n- Ability to break the solution into manageable micro services and have small teams solve them. That increased the speed of development by taking advantage of public cloud, strong devops, and automated testing\r\n- To drive accountability and ownership in a cross enterprise initiative\r\n- We also wanted to break some capabilities away from a monolithic application that was getting difficult to change\r\n\r\nSo, it is the business imperatives that drove us towards the micro services architecture.\r\n\r\nIn general, if it is a differentiating capability for the business (say credit decisioning for a bank) and agility is important, microservices approach helps. If it is not a differentiating capability like payroll and HR, better stick to a vendor product.\r\n\r\nArchitecture:\r\n\r\n- When re-architecting a monolithic application, we achieved better success starting with the head (or customer facing functions) of the monolithic application. As we get deeper there will be more dependencies making it difficult to decompose the application.\r\n- It is important to Identify the business capability and design the contract accordingly. The architecture should be aligned with product owner and it should clearly articulate the problem the specific micro service is solving.\r\n- Use domain driven design as much as possible. It is important to define the domain and the bounded context for the micro service. This also helps to define the granularity of the micro service. If the service is too big, it replicates the monolithic. Maintainability and agility should be kept in mind while designing the micro service. Our definition of a bounded context was driven by the following:\r\n  - Autonomy of the domain, its business context, and self-contained data store without need for replication across microservices\r\n  - The domain is simple to explain\r\n  - In one instance performance dictated its domain. We separated a high performing calculation engine as its own microservice and developed it in GO language.\r\n- Architect should focus on the API contract, interplay of micro services, and ensuring the non-functional requirements are met. It is important for the architect to know where to stop in the design\r\n- What you design for real time may not work for batch. We first designed the microservices for real time first with a requirement of low throughput. But when we started using the microservices for batch use cases that had a higher throughput requirement, the infrastructure design did not work. So, we had to tune and scale up the microservices.\r\n- While building individual microservices was easy, orchestrating the services wasn&#39;t easy. We built Java orchestrations, but very soon the orchestration services became too big to manage. We are experimenting with reactive frameworks.\r\n\r\nDevops :\r\n\r\n- Benefit of micro services is speed of development. Unless the code migration and deployment is automated, it is difficult to manage a micro services factory\r\n- Automate integration testing and performance testing. We built automated testing for individual APIs, but did not build automated integration scripts. That became a bottleneck at the end as we had to do manual testing.\r\n- With micro services, there will be frequent release. Hence, doing blue green deployment helps to minimize the down time\r\n- A cloud first approach works better for micro services\r\n- ATDD is a mandatory practice for micro services\r\n\r\nBest practices and culture:\r\n\r\n- Encourage Small teams of 4-5. If a micro service takes more than 1-2 developer to understand fully, it is too big and will become unmanageable\r\n- Encourage pair programming\r\n- Encourage knowledge sharing. Leverage demos to ensure teams get the big picture. Otherwise, developers will know only their micro service and miss the big picture. We moved away from separate production support teams. Teams support what they build. When we deployed the microservices into production, initially it was difficult to support as developers did not have the entire architecture context.\r\n- With small teams, teams slowly have to graduate to full stack teams that can do everything the micro service needs.\r\n\r\nCommunication to stakeholders:\r\n\r\n- It is important to communicate to clients often and in detail. Write a blog and publish every detail\r\n- Version management is critical\r\n- Contract first design helps in better communication\r\n\r\nOther practical considerations\r\n\r\n- Level of granularity is very important. Be ready to redefine and re-architect often as you go along\r\n- It is impossible to have a separate support team to whom you hand off the micro- sevices after they are built. The eco system gets more complex for some other team to own manage. integrate support into delivery teams\r\n- Alerting and monitoring is extremely important. Automate to the extent delivery teams spend less than 10% of their time on production support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","abstract":"This talk will explain  lessons learnt with micro services architecture, what are the key success factors like cloud, devops, domain driven design, and the practical considerations like production support issues and increased complexity.\n","audience_level":"All","talk_format":"DEV@SATURN Talk (15 minutes)"},"ratings":[{"id":27153,"submission_id":8029,"value":100,"comments":"","created_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:18.406Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:18.406Z","user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"}},{"id":26820,"submission_id":8029,"value":100,"comments":"This looks like a great session based on experience at an established organisation, full of good advise","created_at":"2017-01-27T14:23:00.887Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T14:23:00.887Z","user":{"name":"Chris Cooper-Bland","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f238825a57dff36da715f337d78053ec?s=500","email":"ccb@badgerscroft.com"}},{"id":25470,"submission_id":8029,"value":50,"comments":"this looks like a great experience report with a lot of good advice.

Things I like about this talk: there is a ton of good advice born from real experience covering a range of topic areas that all have to work to get microservices working.  Things I worry about with this talk: there are a ton of topics to cover in 30 minutes and some of it is common advice that has been around for a few years now.\r\n\r\nI generally like what you've proposed and appreciate the focus on lessons based on your experience.  My advice, if this talk is accepted, is to try to tighten the focus and reduce scope or to think about ways to \"chunk\" your advice for easier consumption.  Also think about how you'll reinforce your advice with examples from your experience.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. For reflection: not everybody who's creating microservices uses DDD. What's in DDD that helps to define the best size (actually, the most appropriate functional scope) for a microservice? \r\n\r\n2. Should all microservices match DDD BCs? \r\n\r\n3. What are the challenges of using microservices? Is microservice architecture the best option in all cases? If not, in what situations a more monolithic approach works better? \r\n\r\n4. It seems your lessons learned derive from redesigning (breaking up) a monolithic application into microservices. What's the motivation for doing that? In the organization I work for, new projects are using microservices. However, for the moment, we have discarded the option of redesigning monolithic applications into microservices because of cost and complexity. We have found it useful at times to take cuts of a monolith and repackage as containerized microservices that expose http endpoints though. \r\n\r\n5. You say \"Benefit of micro services is speed of development\". I don't disagree, but I hope you can explain why in your talk. As food for thought, I wrote a [blog post](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2015/11/microservices-beyond-the-hype-what-you-gain-and-what-you-lose.html) about benefits and challenges of microservices. There I argue why you can see improved modifiability with microservices, which is a factor for improving productivity.  \r\n\r\n6. I think the community is settling on a single word spelling for microservice. That's how it's spelled in wikipedia as well. :^)\r\n\r\nTypos: \r\n\r\n- \"more dependencies *that* make it difficult\"\r\n\r\n- \"It is important *to i*dentify the business\"\r\n\r\n- \"*The* architecture should be\"\r\n\r\n- \"ATDD is a mandatory *practice* for micro services\"\r\n\r\n- \"everything the micro service need*s*\"\r\n\r\n- \"Communication to stake**holders\"\r\n\r\n- \"Level of granularity is very important.* B*e ready to\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:11.242Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:11.242Z"},{"id":3738,"submission_id":8029,"talk_id":15249,"user":{"name":"Sairam Tadigadapa","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a5e942ea5ba423a74c096ead2641c67c?s=500","email":"sairam78@gmail.com"},"body":"Paulo,\r\nThank you very much feedback.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. The relation between agile development and architecture work has been examined and discussed for a decade. I'm curious to see your OODA approach. Indeed, I think you should name it in the talk description and make sure it is well described in the talk. \r\n\r\n2. As a sanity check, ask yourself if the approach works well for geographically distributed and/or outsourced teams. Also ask if it requires developers who are well versed in software design (in addition to architects who can code of course). \r\n\r\n3. Years ago I gave an interview to InfoQ. One of the questions was exactly about the topic of your talk. I'll reproduce here my answer. It's just food for thought for preparing your presentation...  \r\n\r\n\"It is a well known misconception that agile development means no documentation. In fact, as a [survey shows](http://www.ambysoft.com/surveys/modelingDocumentation2008.html), agile teams are more likely to model than traditional teams. A few things that agile architects (or perhaps any software architect) should remember: \r\n\r\nThe key aspect of design/modeling in agile projects is not to avoid designing, but to avoid \"big-design up-front\" (BDUF). In general, high-level architectural strategies should be worked out up front, but many design decisions and design details can be left to when you need them. \r\n\r\nOnly produce design documentation that will fulfill a need of the stakeholders. Stop designing as soon as you're ready to start coding. In the next sprint you can expand/refine the existing design as needed in order to capture design decisions required by next sprint's features. \r\n\r\nIf it's not worth updating the design, throw it away. Some design diagrams are used to guide implementation, but at the end the code sometimes looks different from the diagram. If you don't have time to update the diagram to reflect the implementation, it's better to remove it than keeping an out-of-date diagram that may confuse a future reader. \r\n\r\nMany times, sketches are all you need. Don't spend too much time crafting the neatest diagram using the latest and richest notation available. Don't spend too much money on sophisticated modeling tools if you just need a drawing tool. In many agile projects, especially the ones with small, co-located teams, the true value of design diagrams comes from drawing them, which forces you to think through the issues; once the issues are solved, the diagrams lose much of their value. Many times the design is represented as a sketch on a whiteboard or piece of paper. If the sketch can be used to successfully convey the design to the team, that sketch, as is, can be *the* diagram in your architecture view. Why not?\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T16:21:52.816Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T16:21:52.816Z"}]}},{"id":7920,"submission":{"id":7920,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-11T21:00:19.114Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:55:02.620Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":80.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["code-quality"],"profile":{"name":"G.

You'll also see that because there's no \"cost of entry\" / increment for methods, high class-level Cognitive Complexity is a reliable indicator that a class contains a lot of logic, not just a lot of methods. That is, you can use Cognitive Complexity to sift domain classes from the logic-intense classes that impose a higher maintenance burden.\r\n\r\nCognitive Complexity is already available as a new rule in some Sonar code analyzers, and should be available throughout the SonarQube ecosystem by the end of 2017.","notes":"30min Tech Talk\r\n\r\nSonarSource (the company behind [SonarQube](http://sonarqube.org)) is introducing a new way of measuring complexity: [Cognitive Complexity](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cognitive-complexity-because-testability-understandability/), which gives a far more accurate measurement of the relative understandability of a method than Cyclomatic Complexity. \r\n\r\nI'll cover these topics:\r\n* Cyclomatic Complexity: what it's good for and what's it's not, i.e. why a new standard/metric is needed\r\n* Cognitive Complexity: motivations, specifics, benefits\r\n* How to use Cognitive Complexity to guide refactoring.

I think it's fair to assume you're proposing a 30-minute technical talk (talks are 15, 30 or 90 minutes long at SATURN this year).\r\n\r\nI have a few comments/suggestions:\r\n\r\n- It may have gone unnoticed, but the Abstract and the Description don't mention automation anywhere. I'm familiar with cyclomatic complexity, we use sonarqube in our organization, and we follow the \"automate all the things\" motto. I was reading the description and wondering if cognitive complexity could be something analyzable by sonarqube (or other static code analysis tool). When I read in the Description that in this talk I would learn a method to calculate a Cognitive Complexity score, then I imagined the worst: 'it's not automated yet.'  Only when I saw the notes I realized it's automated and, better yet, part of sonarqube. \r\nSo, my suggestion is to make clear in the Description that this approach is automated. I think you should also mention it will be part of the sonarqube ecosystem soon. \r\n\r\n- You may already be planning to, but I suggest clarifying whether cognitive complexity should replace or complement cyclomatic complexity analysis. In other words, in my quality index formula, should I use both, maybe with different weights?  \r\n\r\n- SATURN is focused on software architecture and different code analyses bring a lot of design insight. So, I also suggest drawing a connection between cognitive complexity and design quality. \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-18T02:47:12.638Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T02:47:12.638Z"},{"id":3401,"submission_id":7615,"talk_id":14500,"user":{"name":"G.

In particular, a dependable CPS responds correctly and timely even in situations where system parts have failed, either temporarily or permanently. This requirement also applies when tests check reliability, availability and performance properties of these systems in the lab and in the field. A CPS with test probes built-into all HW/SW-components throughout the CPS lifecycle can fulfill these requirements. Applied to an eCar, non-intrusive, deterministic fault-injection tests executed by test probes provide strong evidence for statements like: “While driving, the eCar can safely be steered when a fault fails a central, redundant HW/SW component that executes steering operations”.\r\n\r\nTests of such systems and properties pose various challenges, for example (1) stimulating selected CPS parts with correct data and with faulty data in rare and critical situations, (2) checking selected CPS parts at selected points in time, or during time intervals according to focused and measurable test goals, (3) differentiation of the CPS's treatment of temporary and permanent faults, and (4) absolute non-disturbance of the tested system's functionality or timing. The fourth challenge applies in particular to fault-injection tests that check CPS safety, or that operate near the border between the CPS and the physical process.\r\n\r\nMeeting the challenges outlined above requires that the architecture of the system under evaluation be designed for testability. Starting from here, we first characterize the CPS we use as an example: an integration platform of an X-by-wire eCar (www.projekt-race.de/en). This motivates the need for reliable statements on the real-time behavior of the system from different tests, from which we derive testability requirements. Afterwards, we elaborate a series of design tactics that enable or improve the system’s testability, focusing on test probes. A test probe is a kind of Built-in Monitor (SEI: Testability tactic) or Maintenance Interface (R. Hanmer: Patterns for fault-tolerant systems) with particular demands in probe environments. When these demands are fulfilled, test probes can execute deterministic, efficient and reliable real-time tests, or act as safety monitors that observe and potentially intervene in a system.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the system domain you will learn two key aspects: how to design a testable system that incorporates test probes as central system elements, and how to write non-intrusive tests that yield reliable results.","notes":"","abstract":"We discuss the practical use of novel HW/SW test probes to non-intrusively check functional, performance, and safety properties in fault-tolerant cyber-physical systems.

Some call it the age of digitalization. No matter what you call it, we are harvesting more and more data about people and businesses. This data is then connected to other data and exposed as services which needs to be protected properly. As software architects, our primary security goal is to write secure software. Secure software has a technical aspect that is well covered (if not understood) in developer literature, but there is also a human and organizational aspect of security we as software architects must manage.  These aspects often go beyond the boundaries of the software development organization and are influenced by forces well beyond the company walls.\r\n\r\nOn the path to security there are a lot of trade-offs to be made, and some of these are made outside the IT organization. After working for more than 20 years in large organizations, I have found that there are certain signals that can be used to identify if you have a weak security culture. They do not necessarily identify security problems in themselves, but are indicators of topics that merit further investigation.\r\n\r\n__In this talk I will cover topics such as:__\r\n\r\n- Balancing prevention, detection and response\r\n- Leadership\r\n- Balancing Short term gains vs long time security impact\r\n- Handling security incidents\r\n- The importance of the curious mind\r\n- Communicating security concerns beyond the IT organization\r\n","notes":"__Note: This talk was originally submitted as a 30 minute talk.

Working for more than 20 years in the IT industry, I have seen security fail in the most spectacular ways. For the past year, the company I work for (Statoil, a global oil and gas company) has seen an increased focus on IT security in the wake of internal and external events. I have been part of a task force addressing some of these issues, and although the particulars are confidential, there are still general learning that can be made. Some of these learnings are technical, but a lot of them are organizational and are valid across organizations large and small. This talk will address the general learnings made as part of the task force, put into a context of more than 20 years experience as an industry practitioner.","abstract":"Security is many things.

In the Description, you say there is also a human and organizational aspect of security we must manage. I find that a little vague. Could you give examples of human and organizational security aspects that architects need to manage?\r\n\r\n2. In the Description, you mention there are signals to identify a weak security culture. You could say explicitly that you will discuss these signals in the presentation--I sure hope that's the case.\r\n\r\n3. Consider adding what participants will learn, that is, how do they benefit from this talk. \r\n\r\n4. I suggest saying either \"As software architects, our primary security goal is to design secure software\"  or  \"As software developers, our primary security goal is to write secure software\"\r\n\r\n5. Since you mention the technical aspects of producing secure software, I'm not sure where does your presentation stand between the project-specific, technical aspects, and the more generic, organizational aspects. Is this talk more useful to a software architect of a system with stringent security requirements, or to the folks in the Information Security Office that are updating the corporate Information Security Policy? \r\n\r\nTypos: \r\n\r\n- \"services which need*s* to be protected properly\"\r\n\r\n- \"Balancing *s*hort\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-19T21:59:51.164Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T21:59:51.164Z"},{"id":3433,"submission_id":8128,"talk_id":15451,"user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"},"body":"PS: The CFP is closed but authors can still *edit* their submissions.","created_at":"2017-01-19T22:00:34.482Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T22:00:34.482Z"},{"id":3648,"submission_id":8128,"talk_id":15451,"user":{"name":"Harald Wesenberg","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ee7b82fe56a8be78842c737d696000a5?s=500","email":"hwes@statoil.com"},"body":"Hi!\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback.

What does the history of software architecture tell us about the challenges of this new environment? And how does our approach to software architecture need to evolve in order to meet them?\r\n\r\nSoftware architecture has been a mainstream discipline since the 1990s and in that time has become a recognised, widely researched and often valued part of the software engineering process. However architecture approaches must reflect the technologies and priorities of the systems we are building and in this regard its future has never looked more uncertain or more exciting. \r\n\r\nFrom our history of monolithic compile time architecture, to many tiered distributed systems, to Internet connected services, we are now entering the era of cloud-hosted, microservice-based, pay-for-usage systems development.

Based on the past 16 years of his life, there is no question about the genius of this kid; but not so much can be said about some of his entourage and followers. Missteps in his career threw shadows of doubt at times about his potential. However, as he matured and opened up to his parents’ wisdom and history, he’s been able to build a well-rounded experience that’s making him competitive for the next phase of his life.\r\n\r\nI wrote my first full-fledge program (app in today’s term) in the Spring of 2001, around the same time Mr. Agile moved into my neighborhood. I didn’t get to know him until early 2004 when his entourage grew into a dedicated community of fans and followers. Back then, I had one trusted mentor and an old friend, Mr. Architecture. Becoming friends with Mr. Agile was new and exciting but brought about challenges to my relationship with my old friend. Therefore, my growing up as a software professional was about learning how I could maintain friendships with both, reconciling their differences, and being better at what I do because of it.  \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I grow up in this kid’s world. So what does that look like? \r\n\r\nIn this DEV@SATURN talk, I’ll narrate the story about growing up as friends with Mr. Agile and Mr. Architecture. I don’t intend to indulge the “agile vs architecture” debate. On the contrary, I’ll annotate my story with examples from our journeys together, sharing experiences with some of Mr. Agile’s friends who advocated architecture sabotage, as well as situations where the outcomes were better because I had a foot in both camps and had won the internal struggle as to how to reconcile.\r\n\r\nCome join me in this talk as I’m sure you’ll find resemblances to your own journey. ","notes":"<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>\r\nThis talk is inspired by Linda Northrop’s keynote last year when she gestured a fist-bump to her chest, a sign of regret, about the stall/damage agile movement did to the progress of architecture adoption. It made me reflect on how I’ve lived the collision of these two worlds. \r\n\r\nAfter discussing an early version of this draft with her, I thought I should write and share my experience in the form of a TED@SATURN talk.\r\n\r\nMy starting thought was the fact that being close to agile movement from the beginning propelled my growth as a software professional, and my practice of software development have been better for it. However, this didn’t come without a struggle against an entourage littered with misunderstanding, incompetence, and lack of discipline.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, it’s clear that the agile pendulum swung too far in the beginning in a zeal to fix the ills of non-agile approaches. But like all physical pendulums, this one had to come back to equilibrium as agile original proponents began to realize that they overlooked some methodology-neutral principles key to developing quality software, including architectural principles.  \r\n\r\nThe punch line in this talk is that at this point agile is a reality. We are at a stage where we need to forgo the discussion about agile for agile sake OR architecture for architecture sake. We need to embrace this agile pendulum equilibrium in the making, and regain the role of those who think about appropriate practices, regardless of methodology, to build high quality software – Software that is fit for its intended use, where fitness has many dimensions beyond pure functionality. \r\n\r\nThe vehicle for me to deliver this is through storytelling based on my own software journey. I'll try to dig out old pictures to put in the background to color the scene.  \r\n\r\n<h1>TALK STRUCTURE (DRAFT)</h1>\r\nFor the purposes of this segment of SATURN, my talk will feature a storyline emphasizing a classic story ingredients.\r\n\r\n<h2>Origination</h2> \r\nYear 2001. \r\nA dozen or so smart software engineers with stellar backgrounds are holding a collective grudge against waterfall-like processes, titles, and roles. Like many revolutions, a manifesto is crafted in a mysteriously remote venue, and subsequently shared with the world: Baby agile is born. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, my induction into the world of software development occurs. A baby software developer is born. \r\n\r\nScene – we live in the same neighborhood. \r\n\r\n<h2>Building towards a crisis</h2> \r\nTime is going to flyby quickly here. \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In the ensuing 10 years, agile grows to garnish a movement that dominates all descending voices challenging it. It's cool; it’s the buzz; and it’s unstoppable.</li>\r\n<li>I meet Mr. Agile for the first time. I’m fascinated (anecdotal incidence here). I go running to my old friend, Mr. Architecture. He’s less fascinated. (I get to know why later). </li>\r\n<li>It turns out, architecture best practices (and a lot of common sense) are the colloquial baby that was thrown out with the bathwater. Architecture vs Agile debate begins to take place. </li>\r\n<li>This makes me extremely uncomfortable. I like both my old friend and my new friend but how can I hang out with them both?</li> \r\n<li>Affiliated agile revolutionaries weren't grounded as leaders in software engineering thereby resulting in a number of documented software atrocities. I witness some of these first hand in my neighborhood.</li>\r\n<li>Moment of truth: Agile is widely accepted but now the epiphany – It isn't the silver bullet after all. Adults in the neighborhood have been saying so all along but the wave was too noisy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Beginning of resolution</h2> \r\nIn the last five years, architectural thinking begins to permeate the conversation among agile leaders. Voices of reason, architecture and agile leaders together, have begun to take charge of the discourse again. They’re beginning to have serious conversations about the real software development challenges at hand with a common goal to build software in a way that is both flexible and sustainable.\r\n\r\nI’m getting really uncomfortable as I now get to go out and watch game with both my old and new friends. (Anecdotal incidence here). \r\n\r\nGreat headways are achieved but also challenges remain with a hopeful future – that of bringing our community together and embracing each other’s strengths.  \r\n\r\n<h2>Ending Monolog</h2>\r\nWhile I feel privileged to have grown up with this boy and met & learned from many of his clique, my work experiences led me to also work in many cases with the cronies. So I finish the story with a call to action for the audience to avoid the dichotomy of us versus them and to regain our role as the chaperons of quality as manifested in the end-products and artifacts regardless of the adopted software development methodology.  \r\n\r\nCurtain close. Audience cheers. Lights off. \r\n\r\n:)","abstract":"If Agile Manifesto were a boy, he'd be a high school junior today. Based on the past 16 years of his life, there's no question about his genius.

The role looks simple on paper: drive good, technical solutions to business problems. But with so much going on at any given moment and constant iteration, staying on top of and affecting outcomes across the board is practically impossible. If you can't even keep up, how can you find time to engage in the decision-making process?\r\n\r\nIn this environment, a 'command-and-control' style architect can encounter significant opposition and find themselves ineffective. Instead, we may consider exploring an entirely different approach. The Influential Architect is fusion of advisor, mentor, facilitator, communicator, and storyteller. As an Influential Architect, our aim is to improve outcomes across the organisation without the organisation becoming reliant on us making key decisions. To achieve this, we have to change the level of abstraction: where previously our purview has been decisions, we must now focus on people. When we can't be in every room where decisions are being made, we must affect the people who are and the process they use.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore what it means to be an Influential Architect, as well as some of the tools and techniques we can use to succeed. We'll cover:\r\n\r\n* Transparent Decision-making.\r\n    * How may we efficiently document and communicate our intentions with regards to technical solutions and what would those documents look like?\r\n    * How may we incorporate other development teams into our feedback cycle without creating bottlenecks?\r\n* The Light on the Hill.\r\n    * What is a technical vision and how does it help both the team and the wider organisation?\r\n    * How do we go about establishing a technical vision and who needs to be involved in this process?\r\n    * How do we hold teams accountable to technical visions, in order to ensure they work towards the same long-term goals?\r\n* Visual Storytelling.\r\n    * How can we effectively communicate technical outcomes to non-technical stakeholders?\r\n    * What are the key components of a good story and how does a story help communicate intentions?\r\n    * What does an example of a visual story that communicates a technical initiative look like?\r\n* Architectural Principles.\r\n    * What are architectural principles and why do we need them?\r\n    * How and in what format are architectural principles articulated?\r\n    * What does the process of establishing them look like to optimise for creating buy-in among technical teams?\r\n    * How may we hold teams accountable to the architectural principles we've established?\r\n* Sensible Defaults.\r\n    * How can we use sensible defaults to avoid reinventing the wheel while at the same time not hinder innovation?\r\n    * How do we go about establishing sensible defaults in an open and inclusive process?\r\n    * How do teams incorporate using sensible defaults in their work process?\r\n* Strategic Thinking.\r\n    * How can we champion long-term concerns in an iterative agile process?\r\n\r\nIn the longer version of the talk, we'll expand on the aforementioned tools by going through them in greater detail with several real-life examples, and also cover:\r\n\r\n* A case study of failures.\r\n    * What were the approaches that didn't work so well?\r\n    * Why did they fail and what can we learn from them?\r\n* Team suitability.\r\n    * Are there any _team_ characteristics that are necessary in order for an Influential Architect to be effective?\r\n    * What can we do to prepare teams for greater autonomy if they are not ready for it?\r\n* Architect suitability.\r\n    * Are there any _personal_ characteristics that significantly make this type of role easier to fulfil for the Influential Architect?\r\n* Evaluating outcomes.\r\n    * How do we measure our own success in influencing teams?\r\n    * How do we know which teams need more (or less) support than others?\r\n    * Under what circumstances might it be acceptable to stray from the technical vision?","notes":"This is probably best suited as a 30 minute talk, but can be expanded into a 90 minute talk if so desired. The presentation has no technical requirements other than a projector for the slides.\r\n\r\nMy presentations tend to be fun and engaging. I strive to offer ideas people can implement as soon as they get back from the conference, interwoven with self-deprecating humour. I gave a talk about Event Sourcing at last year's SATURN which was well received: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TeMYF_JjNg\r\n\r\nHaving lived and breathed the role of Influential Architect at Envato in Melbourne, Australia, I'm well-positioned to talk through the lessons I've learned throughout my journey. At Envato, we have 18 autonomous engineering teams working on several products in the digital marketplaces industry. Over 120 people are directly involved in the day-to-day development and delivery of software projects. As the only person with Software Architecture in my job title, I guide these teams and people to ensure that we are making sound technical descision and are all working towards the same technical vision.\r\n\r\nThe Influence approach we've been trialling at Envato has been very successful, with a transparent decision-making process and better outcomes. For the first time ever, we have a coherent long-term architectural vision that is understood and frequently referenced by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Teams are able to move faster, with the reassurance of knowing they are heading in the same direction as everyone else.\r\n\r\nI'm excited to share what I've learned about the role of a Software Architect at scale. The presentation is packed with advice on what's worked and what hasn't, and has concrete real-world examples rather than abstract ones. There should be interesting content for all types of architects even if they work in very different environments.","abstract":"In a company at scale with many fully autonomous and agile development teams, the architect's role is more about preventing entropy than it is setting direction.

The word “stream” implies a continuous process, but in real life that stream is far from homogeneous. Architects (or whoever else owns the design decisions) find themselves making decisions with widely varying impact, based on information with differing levels of uncertainty, throughout the life of a software solution. On top of that, the way these decisions and their impact are communicated evolves as the audience and the focus of the architectural communication change.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we explore the metaphor of a human lifetime to illustrate various aspects of architectural decision making, throughout a software solution’s life cycle. Amid all the fluidity of the stream of design decisions, we will look for anchor points with common concerns to address and recurring communication needs. We will see how the nature of architectural decisions changes when we go from birth (the first architectural outline) to graduation (making the business case), and find guidance on communicating the architecture at times of life-defining milestones like marriage (committing to the architecture) and revolutionary changes to the solution. The points will be illustrated by real-life examples from an interesting case study.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial is based on Risk- and Cost-Driven Architecture, a popular approach to improve architecture practices in both traditional and agile contexts, with the aim of providing “just enough anticipation” in the architecture. No prior knowledge of RCDA is required to attend.","notes":"This is a 90-minute tutorial.\r\n\r\nDuring the product lifecycle, key aspects of architectural decisions change, depending on the life stage:\r\n\r\n* level of risk and cost control: the cone of uncertainty\r\n* available information to base architectural decisions on\r\n* impact of architectural decisions\r\n* number of architectural decisions\r\n* cost of change to the architecture\r\n\r\nCertain milestones like graduation (approving the business case for the solution) and marriage (the moment after which it becomes very expensive to change the architecture) occur in every solution life cycle. Such milesones lead to standard stakeholder concerns, like affordability, level of risk control and predictability. We use the commonality of these concerns to provide the architect with standard views in their documentation, enabling them to show how the architecture addresses these common concerns.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n1.

However his hypothesis became known as Conway’s law and many organizations can say that they have observed the same behaviors as outlined in Melvin’s original paper. \r\n\r\nHere at IBM Watson, we just completed an initial release of a new microservice-based cloud platform. This service involved multiple teams, multiple microservices and multiple timezones.  We took a cloud product from inception on a lightening fast roller coaster ride to GA in five months, and lived to tell the story. We didn’t get everything right, but we learned alot along the way and we’d like to share those learnings. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will share our experience, and talk about some of the architectural successes and mistakes we made. We’ll talk about how we used Conway’s law, and the inverse Conway manuever to correct some of those mistakes. We’ll also touch on some of the issues confronting our teams with remote team members and how we solved them. We’ll provide a prescription for approaching team architecture based on our learnings. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the presentation, attendees will gained a knowledge of Conway’s law, how to use it to their advantage, and how to take an architecture led focus for team creation and development. \r\n\r\n","notes":"This will be a slide-based presentation with the following tentative outline:\r\n\r\n* Problem statement: Architecting teams is hard to get right the first time.

Thank you. I agree that it would be very applicable to talk about success and failures - due to architectural modularization issues (through Conway's) vs the actual microservices implementation. This distinction is actually quite relevant - as it will allow us to think about how much of an impact a microservices architecture has on top of a modularized team approach, whether positive or negative. I will add that to the agenda.\r\nYou raise a very interesting point about the \"luck\" of being rejected by HBR. What a fascinating topic- you could well imagine that if it had been accepted by HBR - that it could have been missed entirely by the software architecture community and perhaps it would have sprouted more generally into other communities of practice.

What do you mean by \"a cloud product\"? A software product that runs on the cloud? Is the cloud product the cloud platform that you mention in the previous sentence? In any case, can you say more about the nature of the software product?  \r\n\r\n2. If I understood correctly, this talk focuses on the architecture of the *team*, not the software architecture. It talks about team creation, team architecture. Conway's law is indeed about the organizational structure. That's fine! But you say the product is microservice-based. I think microservices are not only independent deployment and runtime elements, but they enable independent, smaller teams. Microservice teams are hence easier to put together and manage. Following this line of thought, we would need more guidelines and wisdom about how to create a team for monolithic applications.  :^)\r\n\r\n3. I often see Conway's Law (which should be Conway's Conjecture by the way) in texts that talk about microservices.

The resulting abstractions lead to more robust code at the core of your application, and can give your business a competitive advantage.

Know the difference between Newtonian-style abstractions and Aristotelian-style abstractions. Aristotelian abstractions are built up piecemeal and are full of corner cases, like Aristotelian physics. Newtonian abstractions are elegant, formal, and composable.\r\n\r\n2. Follow a design process for developing an algebraic abstraction that can compose and easily express solutions (Newtonian style). Building data transformation pipelines is the step most people who are learning functional programming get to from reading and experimenting. Building algebraic abstractions is the next step, but there isn't much literature on the topic (outside of academia)\r\n    1. Elaborate a physical metaphor\r\n    2. Describe the meaning of your metaphor as mathematical statements\r\n    3. Construct the meaning using constructs from the language\r\n    4. Implement the abstraction by refactoring the meaning\r\n\t\r\n\tThe physical metaphor is an important first step that gives us an anchor from which we may use our intuition. We then query our metaphor for its properties and write them in math, which usually means types and equations. After that, we can construct a runnable version of the meaning, being careful to build it out of parts constrained by our statements from step 2. Finally, the implementation becomes an easy matter of refactoring our runnable version.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis topic idea comes from my experience teaching functional programming to people with all levels of experience. There seems to be a logical progression of insights that people go through as they learn about functional programming. I don't see many people getting past the \"data transformation\" step, so I want to present something further. It's hard to say whether it's THE next step, but it is at least one step beyond transformations.\r\n\r\nA lot of the thinking comes from my experience as a professional Clojure and Haskell programmer and the work of Conal Elliott, John Hughes, and Gerald Sussman.\r\n\r\nI have given a version of this talk at Clojure/conj 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJIUoaIvD20 I would love to adapt this to a language like JavaScript.

The presenter will share his personal experience from working with large scale IT governance and setting-up teams for success.\r\n\r\nThe good and to improve:\r\nEnterprise IT is often very different from the ideal large Internet company, yet way more software professionals work in it. Therefore, I think the topic should get some coverage at SATURN.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will deal with organising rather large architecture organisations. Few of the attendees will have the opportunity to influence the setup of such organisations, yet will have to live with the consequences of good and bad choices.

The experiences you have to share sound very interesting.  Can I ask for a little more detail about the approach used?\r\n\r\nWhen I hear of standardising on a common data model I think of the canonical data model pattern [1].  In recent years this approach has been  criticised [2] by those who favour the use of bounded contexts [3].\r\n\r\nDo the pattern and solution from CRA relate to these patterns?  Are there other relevant patterns?

The first paragraph is the short answer and the next two paragraphs are background and explanation.  Your interest is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThe model at CRA uses standards we developed for first data model for data collection which is bounded context.  In the ESRI data model we leveraged the Subtype and domains, where different subtypes drive the domains.  When we morphed the model into the ESRI standard electric utility model, the same holds true as the model is denormalized by mapping feature(i.e. transformer has a transformer layer rather than being one point feature in the point layer).\r\n\r\nThe modeling we applied has a time element.  There is a data collection stage of most any project which will require data to be normalized to geometry (points, lines and polygons representing features as electrical apparatus in the real world).  After this phase there is an information modeling aspect that requires use of standards to apply various third party tools and integrations.  The integrations vary depending on what solutions need to be integrated.  As budgets and priorities come into play the priorities are often different between power utilities.  However, Power utilities require Network Analysis and Power Outage Management Systems to maintain high systems availability.  The return on investment is staggering to implement the outage management and network analysis systems.  In addition the mapping must always tie to Work Management Systems.\r\n\r\nDepending on the Utility size, microservices are typically used, however, there may need to be some cost saving, less expensive integrations such as ETL to move data into another format (i.e. daily job).  This is what happened with CRA and happens with most Power Utilities (even most very large ones).  There is a second reason for the reason web services cannot always be used – much of it has to do with the industry needs a network model that has sufficient performance.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-09T13:43:04.671Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T13:43:04.671Z"},{"id":3157,"submission_id":7667,"talk_id":14587,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nThanks for your submission!

If you create an architecture that doesn’t give value to the customer you are wasting your time. When I talk to customers I often hear horror stories about how their current systems were developed by someone in an ivory tower who didn’t understand them or their work. So how do you make sure that you are bringing value to the customer through your architecture? Use customer centric design processes often called Contextual Design or Design Thinking. These are fundamental parts of Lean and Agile and this session shows how to use them in architecture with hands on experience. In this highly interactive session participants redesign a system by interviewing a customer, creating a prototype, reviewing it with the group, and getting feedback on their design. Using the methods taught in this class you can create value for your customer through your architecture and become their hero, or at least not the person in the ivory tower who is ruining their life.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nParticipants will learn basic methods of contextual design and design thinking and how they apply to the architecture of a software system\r\nParticipants will learn customer interviewing techniques to gain knowledge of the customer's functional and non-functional requirements\r\nParticipants will learn creating prototypes of their architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to give constructive feedback on an architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to receive constructive feedback on an architecture","notes":"My goal for this session is to help architects learn a customer centric design process. I learned this method from the \"Deciding what to Design\" course at Carnegie Mellon. The method is often called Contextual Design or Design Thinking. Its a fundamental part of Lean and Agile. I've rarely seen people show how these methodologies apply to architecture, so thats my goal for class.\r\n\r\nI use this process in my own work at GE and previously at Verizon.  I lead the End to End Customer Experience efforts at Verizon and enabled our architects and software engineers to talk to customers. I gave a talk on that experience at a past SATURN that generated a lot of interest.\r\n\r\nAt GE I am using this method to design a new CI/CD system for our Industrial Internet of Things platform called Predix. Customers (anyone who gets value from the system you are creating) really appreciate working with me. I find out very surprising things by using this method and create much better systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nA slightly modified version of this session has been given before at Code on The Beach and was well received.  I used the \"App for adding contact to network\" use case and it ended up being a common but complex enough task that the groups had plenty to design. The Code on the Beach session was 60 minutes long and I assigned roles to each team member. I didn’t have time to have feedback given to each group, but I think it is an effective way to leverage the knowledge in the room. I didn’t have time to fit in the last wrap up session either, which I think is critical for people to concrete the new information. I've added those two parts to this 90 minute session.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nParticipants will learn basic methods of contextual design and design thinking and how they apply to the architecture of a software system\r\nParticipants will learn customer interviewing techniques to gain knowledge of the customer's functional and non-functional requirements\r\nParticipants will learn creating prototypes of their architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to give constructive feedback on an architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to receive constructive feedback on an architecture\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participatory session will include the following:\r\n15 minutes\r\nIntroduction to Customer Experience Design\r\nIntroduce the hands on Exercise: Design a new system for adding a contact to your network (Linkedin, google+ , etc.)\r\nDivide session into groups of 4 or 5 people.\r\n\r\n10 minutes\r\nActivity 1: Determine what matters to the customer including their functional requirements and quality attributes by watching how they do the task in their natural environment and asking lots of “why’s”. I will ask each group to select someone in their group to be the \"customer.\" Each group will watch their customer collect a business card from a person and add a contact to their network of choice.\r\n\r\n25 minutes \r\nActivity 2: Design the system around the customer’s needs and document it in a prototype. The prototype should be as interactive as possible, not just a flow chart. Prototype should show the architecture elements. Because the “customer” is involved, the team should be constantly getting input from the customer on their on going design. They should also write down any assumptions they are making and any reasons they made design decisions. Finalize the prototype, the assumptions, design decisions, and what they learned from the process.\r\n\r\n30 minutes \r\nActivity 3: Review the prototype with the group. Receive feedback on design. About 5 minutes each group.\r\n\r\n5 minutes\r\nWrap up: Allow the small groups to meet one last time to discuss the feedback and make any changes to their design.\r\n\r\n10 minutes\r\nFinal Group discussion: Discuss what they learned from the session. Find out what they learned from receiving and giving feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","abstract":"Have you heard stories about how systems were designed in an ivory tower by someone who didn’t understand the customer or their goal?

Variations for one-to-few, one-to-many, many-to-many. Tradeoffs. What to embed (_id / natural primary key / more than the natural primary key)?\r\n* However, if an object frequently needs to be accessed on its own, embedding may not be the best choice.\r\n* Don't embed very high cardinality documents on the \"many\" side. Variations and tradeoffs.\r\n* Don't denormalize a \"master\" field / document if it needs to be updated frequently. The cost of finding and updating all the instances may be too high.\r\n* If you frequently need to use data from documents from multiple collections when embedding is clumsy, don't be afraid of join at the application level.\r\n* Use the power of the Aggregation Framework for complex query requirements.\r\n* Get the best out of sharding. Choose shard keys for even distribution of writes and reads.\r\n\r\nFor Cassandra:\r\n\r\n* Again, model around the queries in your application.\r\n* Spread data evenly around the cluster.\r\n* Think of the database as a nested, sorted map data structure.\r\n* Denormalize for fast read performance. \r\n* Find the right balance between normalizing and denormalizing.\r\n* Using column names for values, and leaving the column value empty is OK.\r\n* Leverage wide rows for ordering, grouping and filtering.\r\n* Choose the row key appropriately to partition your records for good performance.\r\n* Segregate the read-heavy data from write-heavy data.\r\n\r\nAs suggested by you, I'll drop polyglot persistence, and model it as \"best practices for NoSQL schema design\". I think I should drop Neo4j, and limit myself to MongoDB and Cassandra for a more in-depth coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-31T17:28:11.274Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T17:28:11.274Z"}]}},{"id":6588,"submission":{"id":6588,"state":"waitlist","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2016-11-21T21:32:43.928Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T22:57:26.735Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8eBXGPl_5E&list=PLe9psSNJBf76DOOKMkDpyo_A5PfZk7JWc","rating":60.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["serverless","javascript","nodejs","awslambda","cloud"],"profile":{"name":"david@serverless.com","bio":"David Wells is a full stack developer at Serverless, Inc. in San Francisco.

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is an architecture pattern on its own that is useful in many situations (e.g., Event Sourcing), not only serverless architectures. \r\n2) Discuss tradeoffs. The talk seems to focus on the benefits of serverless architectures. Every architecture approach has pros and cons. One of the essential skills of the software architect is the ability to weigh tradeoffs against quality requirements. So, I suggest in your talk you examine the tradeoffs involved in serverless solutions. Maybe you already do so, but the talk description doesn't mention that. \r\n3) In the talk description, it would be useful to try to explain in one or two sentences what is a serverless architecture, for the benefit of the conference participants who are not yet familiar with the term. \r\n4) In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it's only tentative.","created_at":"2017-01-03T11:17:05.510Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T11:17:05.510Z"},{"id":3168,"submission_id":6588,"talk_id":12626,"user":{"name":"Michele Falce","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4372b9b36000156c84f2330095214f02?s=500","email":"michele.falce@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi David, is this a 30- or 90-minute talk?

So, for those that have a mature, stable, and effective devOps infrastructure that already abstracts server complexity from developers and for those whose VMs don't have much idle computing time, transitioning to serverless probably isn't going to be cost/risk-effective.  \r\n\r\n- There may be other reasons to not transition: risk aversion (\"this is too new and unproven\"), compliance (\"we neither own the data center NOR manage any of the VM infrastructure??\"), or simple mistrust (\"how do I know it's going to scale when I really need it to?\") It's important that application architects take into consideration their corporate policies, compliance and risk requirements, and organizational change tolerance when considering serverless.","created_at":"2016-12-19T19:19:47.874Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T19:19:47.874Z"},{"id":2928,"submission_id":7119,"talk_id":13610,"user":{"name":"David Aktary","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/5152/2013_THR_David_Headshot.jpg","email":"aktaryda@gmail.com"},"body":"Apologies for the odd message formatting above...

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. The term serverless is actually quite broad and poorly defined. For example, [Mike Roberts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) associates serverless to the use of MBaaS (more common), or alternatively richer clients (SPA?) talking to services behind an API gateway. Your talk probably has a clear description of what a serverless architecture is to you, but I'm thinking a brief definition in the talk description itself would also be helpful to correctly set the expectations of participants looking at the conference program.\r\n\r\n2. Assuming this is a 90-minute participatory session, the talk description (visible to conference participants) at some point has to clearly state this is a hands-on session and attendees should have a github and AWS account, and bring their laptops.\r\n\r\n3.

It is based on the experience of an Architect who prepares his/her best guesses about set of quality attributes and related metrics. 2. As the next step, Architect drives the workshop in a pretty dynamic manner, moving with technologists from customer side checking proposed list of attributes and metrics (by improving list of key attributes and getting threshold values from representatives' side). 3. Formed list of attributes is ranked by priority with technologists of customer. 4. Short meeting with business stakeholders is conducted in order to review formed list of attributes and metrics and checking priorities. 5. Work is done and list of attributes and related metrics is formed.\r\n\r\nSuch approach works extremely good when: 1. There are available technologists on customer side. 2. There are some ready-to-use expectations/understanding about future system performance/availability/etc on customer side.","abstract":"QAW is too massive.

On another hand we are trying to predict list of key quality attributes and verify it vs customer stakeholders after that (starting with technology people if they are available). \r\n\r\nSo, insuring mechanism looks like: \r\n1. Form list of key attributes and metrics for them using your experience (the more mature and experienced your are - the better)\r\n2. Discuss it with customer engineers (Architects, CTOs, etc) and improve/update it with their opinion\r\n3.

Unfortunately, many customers, managers, and developers have little understanding of how to specify, achieve, or verify quality goals.  Barry Boehm ranks qualities among his top 10 sources of serious project risk.\r\n\r\nThe SEI recommends that quality goals be identified in Quality Attribute Workshops (QAWs).  QAWs identify quality goals indirectly with scenarios and rely on “quality experts” to map scenarios onto quality goals.  Unfortunately, this indirect approach does not help customers make tradeoff decisions because of their poor understanding of quality relationships.  While scenarios are useful in describing some quality attributes, such as aspects of performance, they are not as useful for others, such as safety.\r\n\r\nWe propose an alternative approach based on the tailoring of a comprehensive quality attribute model to the needs of a project.  The model contains over 60 quality attributes.  Each attribute has over 30 characteristics including indicators and measures, supporting and conflicting qualities, threats and mitigations, and achievement and verification tactics.  The model also contains guidance on defining, achieving, and verifying quality goals.  The model is freely available at quality-aware.com.\r\n\r\nThis model distinguishes external qualities (visible to users e.g. reliability) from internal qualities (only visible to developers e.g. code readability).  We propose that goals for relevant external qualities be identified and defined in a tailoring workshop that includes most stakeholders.  Internal quality goals should be identified and defined in a meeting of technical management and senior developers.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will review the attributes model and simulate a tailoring workshop.","notes":"","abstract":"Identification of quality goals is hindered by poor understanding of quality attributes.

Please find some of my responses.\r\n\r\n1.\tIn the Talk Description, why is transformation capitalized in SOA Transformation? In particular, this phrase is not clear and somewhat intriguing: \"the Software Transformation journey we should have in a fast-moving environment, where the agility is the key\". Maybe there's more objective motivation for the specific transformations you will describe.\r\n\r\nMost of the organizations which grow very fast tend to first focus on getting things done quickly and later worry about getting things done in the perfect fashion. This kind of accustoms business stakeholders used to seeing quick results. It takes some time to realize the importance of SOA, standardization, governance. When an organization attempts to do a Transformation Journey replacing the majority of the monolithic code base with industry standard COTS/SAAS/Systems/Custom Built Systems, coupled with the transition to SOA there is still a level of impatience to see quick results. Also, there is an expectation that buying SAAS/COTS products means they would start working immediately. These misconceptions posed significant challenges for us to keep providing continuous Business Value as well as working towards accomplishing embracing SOA. So, on one hand, we were doing a major re-haul of our systems and on another hand also making sure that we embrace SOA as well as providing incremental business value. We accomplished SOA not in isolation but by coupling tangible business benefits spread over a period of time also delivering incrementally. Those are the details I would like to share and that’s the reason why I would like to call it an SOA Transformation. \r\n\r\n2.\tI think most of the material out there is settling to using microservices as opposed to micro-services.\r\nI’ll have this corrected. Thank you!\r\n\r\n3.\tIf you find that your talk is too long, I suggest removing the first topic (\"Rackspace - Business and System Perspective\").\r\nPlease see point 4.\r\n\r\n4.\tI think the description is somewhat vague, especially for a 90-minute session. If it's 90 minutes long, it takes the time equivalent to 3 30-minute talks, so the info should be clearly valuable. You mention a case study. Maybe you should say more about the case study.\r\n\r\nThe introduction around Rackspace - Business and System Perspective is supposed to say more about the case study. Based on the time that is allotted, I would get this condensed accordingly. I would ideally prefer 60 minutes. 90 minutes seems to be a stretch.\r\n\r\n5.\tThings you could add to the description to make it more interesting: what technology transformation will you talk about? If it's monolithic to microservices, what do your monoliths looked like? Java EAR apps? MS .NET? Where do you run your microservices? Docker? Kubernetes? What tools and frameworks did you add to your runtime environment, development environment, continuous integration/deployment environment?\r\n\r\nSure I would add more details. The presentation is more around how we introduced SOA, embraced a culture of SOA and the difficulties we faced in the transformation. We had a couple of huge monoliths built mainly using Python/Java and they had undergone many revisions. The processes that we had were initially divergent and people dependent. From there we moved towards SOA, standardization of technology, deployment processes, CI and partly CD, and we could add details around the exact technology selection and standardization process we have also including details about Docker and other technologies we use. The challenges that would be described would be more on the lines of the phased steps we took to provide incremental business value and to reduce risks which helped as accomplish a major transformation. This an ongoing journey and we would talk about how we are beginning to embrace Microservices.\r\n\r\n6.\tI think the most challenging aspect of the monolith-to-microservice transition is finding the appropriate functional scope for the microservices. If they are too small, you may end up with chatty communications and lower autonomy and performance. If a microservice encompasses functional contexts that is too large, you move closer to the monolithic model and may not significantly realize the microservices benefits. What approaches have you used to help define the size of microservices? Did DDD help?\r\n\r\nGreat point, As an enterprise organization, we have not gone into a spree of replacing everything into MicroService. We are finding right use cases where we really could provide value out of carving Micro Services or introducing new MicroServices. I plan to present a case study of one such real use case and the practical benefits we gained from it. We have applied DDD concepts like Bounded Context and also to further split into Sub Contexts to select MicroService Candidates which helps in defining an appropriate logical boundary. We have also beginning to introduce Micro FrontEnds. Also during our SOA Transformation, we had already begun to apply many of the MicroService Principles even though the term hasn’t become popular. We would also provide those details.\r\n\r\n7.\tWhat communication mechanisms did you use in microservices (what connector types)? Http (REST)? WebSocket? Asynchronous messages/events?\r\n\r\nWe have standardized on HTTP/REST. We had also build our own Messaging Infra Structure using REST: Atom Hopper. ATOM was used as the Messaging Standard across the Services. However within the Bounded Context Teams were free to pick appropriate messaging platforms.\r\n\r\n8.\tI think \"methods of how to accomplish large-scale technology transformations\" is quite ambitious. If you don't have exactly methods, but guidelines or best practices derived from experience, that's ok too.\r\nSure I would rephrase as per your suggestion.

The tutorial will cover why web security testing is important, what vulnerabilities are most common and how the ZAP tool can help developers check their software for these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe good and to improve:\r\nPrevious experience and presentations are listed, which increases the confidence that the presenter can deliver the material well.

I think this may be needed to get the confidence that the English accent of the speaker is easily understood.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the talk is on testing and the author’s experience includes mostly developer conferences. It is unclear how the talk’s take-aways are relevant for architects, clarification on this point would be helpful. For example, does ZAP help applying design patterns? That said, many developers attend SATURN and many architects code.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes listed are ambitious for a 15-min talk. It runs the risk of becoming a sales pitch for ZAP and an invitation to contribute to the project.

The proposed session was for 1hr. I may have selected 15minutes talk format by mistake.\r\n\r\nTo keep the talk technology agnostic, I am not only focusing on ZAP security tool but also on other open source web security tools such as Vega Scanner, Open VAS, Nikto and Uniscan. \r\n\r\nDue to time constraint, I will be showing live demo only on ZAP. Its not gonna be like sales pitch at all. I am just using a tool to help me find the vulnerabilities in web application so that developer can know and build application more securely.\r\n\r\nIf my talk is accepted under Technical Talks and Tutorial track (assuming each talk will be given 1hr duration), my talk will be following below structure:\r\n\r\n-> Importance of Web Secuirty - 5min\r\n-> Discussing OWASP Top 10 vulneribities [Each vulnerabity will take 2min for discussion] - 20min \r\n-> Talking about 4 available open source tools [4 tools X 5min] - 20min\r\n-> Live Demo [Scanning vulnerable web application to detect vulnerabilities and various other features of the tool] - 10min\r\n-> QA - 5min\r\n\r\nAbout ZAP: \r\nThe OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world’s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by hundreds of international volunteers. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. Its also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing.\r\n\r\nIt is a great tool for web developers but not much use for software architects.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further queries, feel free to ping me at damarla.sumanth@gmail.com\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T10:48:05.587Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T10:48:05.587Z"},{"id":3561,"submission_id":7648,"talk_id":14553,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Sumanth, you should still be able to go in and update your submission, please go ahead and do so.

In agile projects, this means being part of every sprint that needs architecturally significant decisions. In order to do this successful, a good collaboration between the technical lead and the architect is necessary. What I've regularly seem in practice, is that both roles are not always present in the same team: some projects might be to small (budget, man days, scope, ...) while many others are organised sub-optimal. One of your review-colleagues also pointed this out.\r\n\r\nBoth roles have some things in common (eg. leadership) and some of the tips I want to provide, should assist in creating this synergy: as a technical lead pay attention to architectural decisions, collaborate on the decision-making process. Get involved. You can see that this requires a different approach with or without a formal architectural role. I too often saw technical leads putting all their focus on \"tools\" and \"frameworks\" and I believe this alone is not enough to deliver successful systems (and sometimes it can be enough). Leadership is about being able to delegate, collaborate (with architects, developers, business people, ... stakeholders). An architect should embrace working with a technical lead, guide him, elevate him. And a technical lead should also embrace working with an architect: support him with technical options, ...\r\n\r\nI strongly believe collaboration will aid both roles to perform better and become better. The roles have both similarities and differences. And that's a really good thing.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nBart Blommaerts","created_at":"2017-01-24T08:25:28.238Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T08:25:28.238Z"},{"id":3601,"submission_id":7199,"talk_id":13762,"user":{"name":"Ged Byrne","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef4de37718ebb5c4fc1c2236331ee9d9?s=500","email":"ged.byrne@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Bart,\r\n\r\nThanks for replying.

However, I'm not so interested in the implementation details.\r\n\r\nI would love to see a talk provide an good, practical overview of the topic for the architect.  This is an area of debate for architects, so I think it is a very relevant field for discussion.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the first addition of \"Software Architecture in Practice\" the statement was made: \"Making a system's user interface clear and easy to use is primarily a matter of getting the details of a user's interaction correct … but these details are not architectural.\"\r\n\r\nIn later editions this position was retracted with a section called \"Usability Mea Culpa (or that’s not Architecture)\" but other architects still disagree.  Consider this blog post that insists that usability is important, but still not architecture: http://enterprise-it-architecture.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/usability-is-not-architecture-quality.html\r\n\r\nAs somebody with a passion for and experience of achieving accessibility, could you explain to architects why this is an important quality attribute and the role that architects play in improving it?\r\n\r\nIf you could include some well defined quality scenarios [1] and relevant architectural tactics [2] that would be very desirable.  The testing approach would be covered by the tactics and you might want to focus on this in particular.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this would be quite a deviation from your current proposal.  You may think of something closer to what you already have that will help to convince architects that this is something they need to be interested in.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=4\r\n[2] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=5\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z"},{"id":3640,"submission_id":7723,"talk_id":14675,"user":{"name":"Gerard Cohen","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/3931/GerardKCohen400x400.jpeg","email":"gerardkcohen@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Ged,\r\n\r\nI can understand why architects do not feel that usability, or UI, belongs in the realm of architecture. I can tell you from my own personal experiences that bad/ lazy service architecture can definitely impact and lead to bad UI. A lot of times, these things are in the name of security or performance and sometimes they can be smoothed over on the front end, but most times they can't. Speaking as a Front-End architect, performance is just as much a part of usability as accessibility is. \r\n\r\nI would agree that implementation of accessibility will not be of any interest to most architects, unless they are front-end like myself. But if you are interested in having the discussion of how bad architecture could lead to bad usability, I certainly have a few anecdotes that I could share.","created_at":"2017-01-25T03:33:17.197Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T03:33:17.197Z"},{"id":3644,"submission_id":7723,"talk_id":14675,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"There was a great [talk on globalization last year at SATURN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPabgSykvD8&list=PLSNlEg26NNpy1RjhlISNMRNO1gypYaXHo).  I like the idea of talks that try to find connections between architecture design and UX design.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through some accessibility training I do think there are architectural concerns and many of the trade-offs Gerard mentioned come to bear.  At the same time, it seems that most of web accessibility is related to implementation details - color choice, proper tagging, good naming, navigation orders for JAWS, etc.\r\n\r\nI think the goal for most SATURN attendees would not be to become an accessibility expert, but to learn enough to not make bad trade-offs as Gerard mentioned (e.g. security over accessibility) or at least be aware that trade-offs are happening.

Also there is an importance of supporting evolution and change to a software-intensive system, and the practical implications of creating a change-ready system. The ability to adapt these changes is driven by two factors, Architecture and Agile Practices. This presentation shows some of the techniques an architect can use to be effective in the fast moving agile environments.\r\n1.\tA hybrid form combining both explicit and emergent architectural techniques. This approach explains\r\n\t      (i) How alignment is the part of architectural work where an architect makes sure that the solution fits its mission?\r\n\t      (ii) How distilling the direction of change, and designing the domain essence are explicit architectural activities?\r\n\t      (iii) How creating the detailed structure, and designing the domain essence can be done in an emergent way\r\n2.\tTrace the history of software development practices from waterfall phases through iterative design to agile techniques.

Agile architecting is a topic of interest as development times continue to shorten.\r\n\r\nCould you explain more about what type of agile development you are addressing? You have mention \"agile software development process\" (lowercase agile) and \"Agile Practices\" (uppercase Agile). There can be differences, and audience members may make incorrect assumptions. Will the talk address how architecting activities relate to some specific Agile methods (for example, sprints) or is it more about architecting in a less strictly defined but still rapidly changing environment?\r\n\r\nIt may be difficult to present all the proposed content in 15 minutes. The abstract describes five topics, some with subtopics. If you need to shorten it, I suggest that the history information (waterfall to iterative to agile) could be trimmed out. That is information audience members can find in other places (for example, on the Web).\r\n\r\nHow you specifically combined architecting tasks and work produces with agile timelines, and how you are able to continually revise the architecture without big tear ups and lost work will be most valuable to audience members. I suggest a focus on those aspects (that is, your topic 3).\r\n\r\nFor which track is this talk proposed?

Please see below my answers to your questions.\r\n\r\nIn this topic, I was trying to address how architecting activities relate to Agile Software Development (ASD) methods (for example Scrum).

So here I will concentrate more on how to continually revise the architecture without big tear ups and lost work or how to avoid design erosion.  \r\n\r\nI think this will fit on Track 1 (how architects can be effective in fast-moving, agile environments)\r\n\r\nSo here is my revised abstract on this topic.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, there is a question central to many discussions surrounding agile approaches to architecting software: In agile process, is the architecture of the system designed up-front, or does it emerge over time as the result of the agile software development process such as Scrum? However, according to the followers of Agile Software Development (ASD) methods, upfront design and evaluation of Software Architecture are likely to consume lot of time and effort without providing a valuable deliverables. The proponents of Software Architecture believe that sound architectural practices cannot be followed using agile approaches.

Or if the intent is to share a set of libraries to solve a specific problem, what is the problem and patterns the libraries help solve?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-22T22:25:56.960Z","updated_at":"2017-01-22T22:25:56.960Z"}]}},{"id":7397,"submission":{"id":7397,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2016-12-30T20:16:16.478Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T20:03:43.696Z","additional_info":"I have taught this class to hundreds of developers over the past year with excellent reception.

An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices","description":"An invisible app? An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices\r\nI know what you're thinking. You want to know what the triple-A app titles already know. It's Inclusive Design, a process to deliver intuitive usability; it is the heart-and-soul of great User Experience and innovative interactions. Your app is in a cosmic battle with the Uninstall button; inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor. Appeal to your largest audience, provide cohesive experiences, and reduce development costs. It is an investment with one of the best returns in all of software. It's simple, cheap and awesome.\r\n\r\nApplication security is fundamental to software from initial design to every line developed. Security should not be an afterthought. Similarly, usability has this same ubiquity throughout the life-cycle of software. The fastest, most secure, most scalable software can end up in the trash because it misses the most important success criteria for any program in the universe - user acceptance. Software architecture profoundly impacts usability. Usability profoundly impacts acceptance. Architects may not choose app colors, error messages, and device layout, but they certainly make choices that enable and constrain designers options that make our software better. Like security is everyone’s responsibility at some level, so is usability at some level.\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees learn? Inclusive design isn’t only usability; it’s recognizing that your user base changes as their social and environmental contexts change. If your user is standing in the sun, waiting for a train in the snow, holding a baby, riding a bus, visiting a library or watching the big game in a sports bar, applications can account for the one type of user that, given a certain context, looks and acts like another type of user. Inclusive design helps developers understand these contexts. It applies these to our implementations to add modalities, flexibility in workflows, and intentional tolerance for user mistakes. Developers will learn to recognize contextual assumptions and apply new, potential contexts to their existing user base so they can serve them best while consequently serving a new, larger user base.

At first glance (and from my previous limited knowledge) I thought it was part of UX.  So while something that architects might have an interest in, probably not something they'd do themselves.  I take your point that it needs to be everyone's business, but what I can't tell is the impact on architecture.  Will you be focusing on how the architecture enables or constrains inclusive design?

In your talk, design is User Interface design if I'm not mistaken. Not a problem, but it would avoid someone the confusion if you explicitly said UI desing somewhere (example: \"Inclusive UI Design\"). \r\n\r\n2) In the Description, it would be useful to qualify app as \"mobile app\" in at least one place. \r\n\r\n3) This sentence is not clear to me: \"inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor.\"  I'm not sure changing the nature of my app is a goal to pursue.

","description":"The software architect is the lone carrier of DNA for the vision of the product, but does not work alone. He/she is placed on a project (“situation”) where he/she must still deliver. The big band drummer can single handedly guide a band, and is placed on a gig (“situation”) where he/she must deliver. What is at the core of the big band drummer’s DNA to bring about success and what parallels might we draw between the two? Come and find out.\r\n\r\nSometimes the most efficient way to a fresh perspective is to sit in the seat of someone else from a totally unrelated field. Reading Harvard Business Review, competitive companies seek advice from totally unrelated fields to solve their most difficult problems. So why should it be any different for software architect?  The software architect’s role in leading teams and influencing business decisions cannot be overlooked. \r\n\r\nJohn Ryskowski would love to reveal the big band drummer’s strategy for success and its attendant parallels to the software architect’s “situation.”  Of course, band stories and drumming demonstrations will be included.\r\n","notes":"Session Requirements:\r\n1) To start a conversation that will last throughout the rest of the conference. \r\n2) To obtain a “fresh perspective” by taking folks down the path of a totally unrelated field and drawing pertinent parallels for and with them. \r\n3) As an architect one must create and nurture the vision for the DNA of the product, in spite of the project situation. The big band drummer must nurture a good sound from the big band, in spite of the gig situation. The parallels between the two should be realized, discussed, and brought to grounded historical experiences for each attendee. \r\n4) To introduce some new language that may help put project situations into perspective allowing one to return to clarity of thought. Psychologically speaking we get some relief from having name for some events or techniques. For example, I need to vary my intensity to get the group affect that I desire.\r\n\r\nThe session breakdown:\r\nHandouts: The actual drum chart for the subject of the talk- Kubis’ arrangement of “A Train,” and the “Clapping at Camp” chart written for audience participation. Big sticky papers will be on the walls of the room. \r\n\r\n1) Explain how one path to a fresh perspective is to experience something that is totally unrelated, but at the same time reveals grounded parallels to your situation. Executing a big band chart requires a strategy with known techniques but the flexibility to grab opportunities to inspire and transcend the moment. Through subtle and timely queues, the drummer can instill a sense of confidence and inspire the band to play better than they imagined. The techniques we discuss could have the same effect for the people on the architect’s project.\r\n2) Through demonstration, we discuss some of the possible variations the drum set can offer. This would include the elements of the drum set with each of their different sounds, the 4 limbs of the body, and just some of the combinations thereof. We will stick with the combinations that are most pertinent for this talk, and don’t forget the eyes and brain play a role as well. \r\n3) We get into a discussion about some of the situations the big band drummer must deal with. Does the band leader know little about music (or does the manager of the program or product owner know little about the technology)?  Does the lead trumpet think he is with the Count Bassie band (or is your development principle unaccustomed to this environment)? Can the bass player not play in time (or does your development principle have no sense of time)? Is the drum set in the absolute worst location to work with the rest of the band (or are you stuck without a reasonable means of communication with the rest of the team)? I will demonstrate how the big band drummer overcomes each of these situations. \r\nI then ask each member of the audience to choose which situation they resonate with most. Audience members will then join 1 of 4 groups to discuss their personal situations, their solutions or possible solutions then elect the top 3 solutions to brief the rest of the other groups. \r\n4) Two vital techniques in big band drumming are then discussed: “Distinguishing signal from noise” knowing the current location of the chart without listening to anyone’s sense of time, and “Some of your great ideas may not be so great.” The audience will then be asked to verbalize their own parallels, and If the interest and energy are present, we can briefly split into two groups, discuss and brief.\r\n5) The “Kubis” chart is then projected on the screen and actually played on the drum set asking the audience to try and observe, as best they can, all that is going on with the drum set performance. We then deconstruct each element of successful drum chart execution. Each element and a lesson to take away:\r\na) Element- Initiating and maintaining a tempo for the band. Lesson- What is least exciting for you may be most important to them.  You set the tone for what is to come and instill a sense of calm. Sometimes you’re just a piece of leverage. Wow that last one hurt.\r\nb) Element- Identify milestones. Lesson- Marking points in time to celebrate progress, ensure social/technical alignment, and instill confidence.\r\nc) Element- Vary intensity as needed. Lesson- Selectively applying energy at the right times and in the right places, balancing support, teaching, and inspiration.\r\nd) Element- Special care. Lesson- Sometimes hand-holding is necessary.\r\ne) Element- Set them up for success. Lesson- Anytime you set someone up for success, they feel good and want to work with you. \r\nThe audience is once again, asked to choose which of these they resonate with most. Audience members will then join 1 of 5 groups and discuss their personal situations (or parallels) amongst their group. Each group will then brief the other groups. \r\n6) The “Clapping at Camp” chart is introduced. I show how without even being able to read music (or a rhythm chart) I can still set them up for success. We rehearse the sections of the chart. Then we perform the chart together and they clap in time like they were born to do it. It’s really fun.\r\n\r\nPresentation History\r\nThis topic has been presented at Agile West, Las Vegas, 2016. \r\nSummary score of 8.69. Total attendees 45.

This is an efficient path to a fresh perspective, which is the most valuable take-away from any conference.  \r\nThe ideal reaction cycle I strive for is: a) I wonder what that would be like, b) cool I didn’t know that, c) whoa I need to try this out. \r\nI have spoken at Agile West, CMMI Institute Conferences, Pacific Norhwest Software Quality Conference, National Defense Industrial Association.

There are different ways to approach this, with perspectives on people, process, or product. It is not necessary to cover all perspectives though I’d like to better understand where you will probe for parallels. Do you think the product (software architecture) will be a point of discussion or will it be more about stories of people and process?\r\n\r\nYour notes provide a good sense of the topics covered and the flow through the session.

The group participation discussed in steps 3, 5, and possibly step 4, in the SATURN proposal are an addition to this version of the talk. These group exercises will allow for a richer processing experience for the folks than what happened at AW. All this added up gives me about 35 minutes for 2 or 3 group participation exercises which should be no problem. This is general time estimate, if specific time allocations are required I would be happy to add them.  Additionally, in this limited time, at AW no parallels to architect came up at AW.\r\n\r\nAs for being under topic 3, I am happy to go with that. People, process, or product- the parallels will focus mostly on people. People are the common point between BB drumming and architects. But to be honest with you, I am not sure where these group exercises will go. One of the verbal comments after my talk at AW was that I did not presuppose to know the parallels exactly, and left space for attendees to formulate their own. It is the opening of this space that is my objective, less so giving a direct answer.   \r\n\r\nFrom you- The breakdown into element and lesson gives a sense of the parallels between drummer and leadership (in general). Would you say more about the points you will make about how these relate more specifically to the architect’s “situation”. \r\n\r\nResponse- From the 5000 foot perspective, the BB Drummer and architect have the same challenge. Take responsibility for the vision and integrity of the product without being given any authority or owning any of the resources. From lower altitude I am happy to make some adjustments though I do worry about anchoring, or disrupting where participants can go with their parallels. How do you feel about the “additions” below?\r\n\r\n5a) Element- Initiating and maintaining a tempo for the band. Lesson- What is least exciting for you may be most important to them.  You set the tone for what is to come and instill a sense of calm. Sometimes you’re just a piece of leverage. Wow that last one hurt. Addition- While trying to balance creativity, risk, stakeholders and the responsibility to change the world, it is good to have a basic rhythm that all can operate to. \r\n\r\n5b) Element- Identify milestones. Lesson- Marking points in time to celebrate progress, ensure social/technical alignment, and instill confidence. Addition-  Is there a build and release rhythm you can work to?\r\n\r\n5c) Element- Vary intensity as needed. Lesson- Selectively applying energy at the right times and in the right places, balancing support, teaching, and inspiration. Addition- The creative process comes down to a give and take in real time. You must dabble in interactions with people in the “known” before you can step over to the “unknown.”\r\n\r\n5d) Element- Special care. Lesson- Sometimes hand-holding is necessary. Addition- Sometimes you don’t have to blow up the village in order to save it. Education and patience can pay off. \r\n\r\n5e) Element- Set them up for success. Lesson- Anytime you set someone up for success, they feel good and want to work with you. Addition- Introduce people to the patterns that you see with grace and composure to assure overall success. \r\n\r\nBest- John \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T01:50:50.787Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T01:50:50.787Z"}]}},{"id":7988,"submission":{"id":7988,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-13T07:16:01.261Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T20:03:44.013Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":36.2857142857143,"trust":70.0,"tag_list":["community building","architects","education","career path"],"profile":{"name":"Dmitriy Gurskiy","bio":"Senior Solution Architect, Deputy CTO at EPAM Systems\r\n\r\nTechnology stacks: .NET, JavaScript\r\n\r\nBusiness domains: Science, Finances, Insurance, Media and Advertizing","twitter":"","company":"EPAM Systems","url":"","shirt_size":"Men's M","email":"dmitriy_gurskiy@epam.com","location":"Unknown"},"talk":{"title":"Building architectural community of seven hundreds engineers in global ISV company","description":"Being a Deputy CTO in global ISV company, I 'm responsible for Solution Architecture discipline growing.

Your talk seems very interesting and will probably attract a lot of people, because SPA and frameworks like Angular and React are very popular these days. However, SATURN is a conference where the primary focus is software design. Although attendees are interested in talks focused on implementation, many also expect to see a design discussion. \r\n\r\nHere are some suggestions that could make a talk on Angular 2 more suitable for the SATURN conference: \r\n\r\n1. What are the tradeoffs of creating single page applications (versus traditional Web app frameworks like JSF)? What are pros and cons wrt usability, performance, maintainability, portability, testability, etc.?  \r\n\r\n2. How should you design server-side components for interaction with SPA apps? Serverless? Microservice? Nodejs? \r\n\r\n3. What evaluation criteria should be used to pick a JavaScript framework? Technology choice is an important design decision and many organizations today are choosing among options such as AngularJS 1, AngularJS 2, ReactJS, EmberJS. \r\n\r\n4. How would you organize the implementation artifacts of a software project that contains AngularJS for the presentation layer, and, for example, Java-based microservices?  This organization is directly related to the deployment view of the architecture, and affects the way you structure the artifacts on a git repository, as well as the way you create your CI jobs. \r\n\r\n5. What are lessons learned and good practices beyond the basics of AngularJS and Typescript programming? What tools or browsers work better for debugging? Any way to analyze code quality (ESLint, TSLint)?  What criteria to choose between bootstrap, material UI, angularUI, etc.? What's the best way to deal with CORS? And so on.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-10T10:52:04.716Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T10:52:04.716Z"}]}},{"id":7895,"submission":{"id":7895,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-11T14:59:39.001Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T20:03:43.639Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36g1aoVvyrY\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISKA10JQOuo\r\nhttps://www.infoq.com/presentations/server-nashorn-spring","rating":37.75,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["testing","agile","cloud","cd","ci"],"profile":{"name":"Topher Bullock","bio":"Topher is a senior software engineer at Pivotal and is based out of the Toronto, Canada office.

Generally I cover the internals to illustrate why Concourse is a good solution for a specific case within CI/CD, but I can also move more towards a generalist CI/CD strategy talk where Concourse is simple an illustration of a solution to a specific problem.\r\n\r\nA specific example I cover is how testing commits to various microservice repos can be integrated together into a pipeline that eventually deploys software externally, and I show an example Concourse pipeline that illustrates this. I can definitely expand more on the former, and provide a good CI/CD strategy overview in the context of distributed systems, microservices, and container orchestration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback!

Yes, the process here is we'll share some feedback you can use to update your submission or clarify with the tech committee, then next week we'll look at all the submissions and finalize the program taking into account the strength of the proposals but also make sure we have a good breadth and depth of relevant topics.\r\n\r\nHere are a few thoughts for your consideration.  This looks like good technical content and a nice, tight focus, but I worry that the primary SATURN audience will find this too low level.  If you are able to make a clearer connection from C++ corner cases and language \"oddities\" to broad systemic properties such as maintainability, performance, testability, etc. then I think the proposed talk could be a better fit for the audience.\r\n\r\nWe certainly cover technology and programming languages at SATURN, but the emphasis is on architectural design.  Perusing some past presentations might give you a better feel for the types of topics and level of detail https://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2016/\r\n\r\nThis proposal could also be made stronger by providing a bit more detail, especially for a 90 minute talk.

The double proposals leave it up to us to judge what is the best way to get your message across, which may or may not work in your benefit.\r\n\r\nI like the building a team aspect of your talk, architects often double as leads in one way or another, with or without reporting line responsibility. It seems that you have delivered or intend to deliver this material at developer oriented conferences. We usually see some (lead) developers at SATURN, but please clarify whom your presentation will work for or how it will work for different groups.\r\n\r\nYour outline confuses as it is up-high (team-building) and down in the details (hands-on penetration testing). Now having read both proposals, I'd recommend you to update the 30 min session to a focussed talk with a clear value proposition for architects and lead-developers. Dropping more technical material. Think about your audience and what they need, looking at previous SATURN conference programs gives you an idea of what the reviewers think our audience likes.\r\n\r\nGood luck with generating publicity around your book!\r\nThijmen","created_at":"2017-01-23T19:18:23.938Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T19:18:23.938Z"},{"id":3577,"submission_id":8056,"talk_id":15299,"user":{"name":"Kim Carter","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3d048d750886711537e12649d0b305c1?s=500","email":"Kim.Carter@binarymist.net"},"body":"This submission is a tutorial or workshop. \"Secrets of a High Performance Security Focussed Agile Team\" is a 25-30 minute presentation.\r\n\r\nBoth of the two submissions work well, it depends mostly on how much time you can allow. The presentation is not hands on, where as the workshop is. Many people find that they learn better if they actually play with the tools. Playing with the tools is what happens in This workshop. The workshop will work well if we can get the VM I have to attendees before the workshop. Attendees need to have this setup and runable before the workshop, otherwise it usually takes up to much time during the workshop. If we can get a network share setup that attendees can download the VM, and follow the directions I provide before the workshop then it usually works well. Also having a box of NTFS formatted 16GB USB sticks loaded with my VM, that can be handed out on and/or during the conference or even in the workshop, has worked well as a backup plan.\r\n\r\nThis submission can also be run as a tutorial, which takes less time, due to the non hands on nature, no one has to set anything up other than myself. If run as a tutorial, I just run through the tooling parts as a workshop myself. This way attendees get more of an idea how things fit together than they would if it was just the short presentation.\r\n\r\nNumbers also play a part in what works best. If a large number of people wish to attend, then the presentation works best. If over 20 - 30 developers attend, then usually the workshop turns into more of a tutorial, unless, we are really organised and attendees are fully setup before the tutorial/workshop. I have 4 USB  sticks that I can pass around during the workshop, but this only works if there are 20 or less developers in the class.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, the workshop offers the most, but only if you can support the facilities required and both of us provide excellent comms to people wishing to attend the workshop in the weeks and days leading up to it. My preference is the presentation, as it is less work, but it's your call, I'm happy to run either.\r\n\r\nI have run quite a few training's similar to this before:\r\n\r\nNodeConfEU (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#security-regression-testing-with-zapapi-and-nodegoat-nodeconf-eu) was a similar workshop (45 people in the class), that may have ended up more of a tutorial, but didn't as we had a box of USB sticks loaded and a network share and had good comms with the attendees before the session.\r\n\r\nDevSecCon (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#devseccon-asia-2017-developing-a-high-performance-security-focussed-agile-team-2-hour-workshop) is aiming to host a similar workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, developers/engineers generally get a lot out of this. For me, I generally try not to differentiate to much between devs and architects. An excellent architect should still have their hands on the tools, it's just that they are also expected to be in a lot of other places at the same time. For the architects with less hands on involvement, the tutorial or even presentation style may be best suited to them. In saying that though, if everyone is setup before the workshop, then I can usually hold hands fairly firmly through the hands on content.\r\n\r\nThe content, whether hands on or not, in many cases is quite eye opening, so there are good take aways for all. My last presentation at AgileNZ (https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/#agilenz2016-agile-security-for-web-developers-50-minute-presentation) which was mostly targeted toward developers, was still well received by the audience which were mostly Product Owners, Managers and Architects. The AgileNZ presentation had quite a bit of the same content as what I've submitted here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high and low level together is what my book series addresses and encourages development teams (PO's, Managers, Architects, Engineers) to grasp and understand. First chapter being 30'000 foot view, which leads into 10,000 foot view, then into some fairly detailed asset identification, risk identification, countermeasure identification, etc... based on Bruce Schneier's Sensible Securitty Model (SSM). The content teaches all people involved in the process of building technical solutions to think outside of their tunnel vision. Architects to think about low level details and Engineers to think holistically, hence the title: \"Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developer\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by clear value proposition? Does the following not provide this:\r\n\"have proven their value in:\r\n(1) Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market)\r\n(2) Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs)\r\n(3) Without descoping\r\nand all while reducing total project cost (fact)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be happy for some assistance to formulate this better for SATURN if you would be keen to help?\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that has clarified most of it?\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T23:00:13.067Z"},{"id":3622,"submission_id":8056,"talk_id":15299,"user":{"name":"Thijmen de Gooijer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df03c0a447fa0f46beee248e87fbf19b?s=500","email":"thijmen@degooijer.name"},"body":"Hi Kim, thank you for the clarification!

In the dojos I have setup / ran, teams are building their products while learning new skills and directly applying them to what they are building.  To give you an example, the last team I was with was building an OAuth service to be used by multiple front-ends.  So they were learning OAuth, along with microservices (Spring Boot in this case), while building with drone / gradle, deploying via kubernetes...all done test driven.  We were doing this in the frame of building their product.  For the majority of the people - it was two teams, about a total of 10 developers - these were new skills. So instead of reading a site and trying to apply something or take a course in one topic, we sat and worked directly with teams on how to build 'the right product, the right way.'  Other teams have learned Java (coming from mainframe), mobile development, etc.  I have even ran these with non-technical teams like L&D or marketing.\r\n\r\nSo what goes on?  Learning in the context of building your stuff.\r\n\r\nI am of course biased to a dojo approach - I like the idea of whole teams learning together in their context.  I would offer up that if you just have a single skill that needs to be amplified, a dojo wouldn't be right.

The SEI should know this and lead a campaign to fix it.\r\n\r\nAgilists believe that requirements “emerge” during iterative development.  They also believe that Big Requirements Up Front (BRUF) is an Agile anti-pattern.  While BRUF may be a poor strategy for gathering functional requirements, it is the best strategy for identifying quality goals.\r\n\r\nMost functional requirements may eventually emerge because of clearer customer understanding.  Unfortunately, most quality goals will not and those that do are unlikely to emerge early.\r\n\r\nInternal quality goals such as code understandability and testability, will never emerge from domain understanding.  Some high-profile external goals such as safety, security, and privacy may emerge, but at unpredictable times.  Others, such as ease of use, reliability, and responsiveness, will emerge if there are gross quality failures.  A focus on functionality will delay emergence of most quality goals.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, waiting for quality goal emergence is a poor idea and unnecessary.  Waiting results in the accumulation of sizable technical debt during early iterations.  Debt piles up because quality support functions, such as exception handlers, are missing everywhere.\r\n\r\nUse of a comprehensive quality model enables quality goals to be identified early.  It also enables the early specification of both quality achievement and quality verification strategies.  Such a quality model is freely available at www.quality-aware.com/q-a-daves-stuff.php.  The steps to fix Agile and any other incremental development process can be found at www.quality-aware.com.\r\n\r\nSEI publications state that understanding quality goals is an important prerequisite to good architectural decisions.

This is not altogether different for how small startups often stumble or fail when they try to transition to the big leagues.  As far as context goes, I think this applies to any web, desktop or mobile system (internal to an organization or used by the public) that is intended to be used by individuals in multiple countries across the globe.  In particular if you are dealing with private or sensitive data.  When I refer to the “global jungle” I am talking about the multitude of things that you often don’t think or worry about when you \"first build\" your solution for your \"first user base\", but can be a catastrophic problem when you try to transition to a new region or the globe (and forces you back to the drawing board or worse yet becomes a fatal flaw and threatens your overall business model).

Instead I want to give them an awakening so that they walk away with a new found appreciation that there are a bunch of other things they should spend some critical time on; since by spending it now it may very well either save their project from an unanticipated problem or differentiate them since their competitors failed to consider them.  Think back to when you first heard the horror stories around security and that had a lasting impact on your belief that it is something that shouldn’t be ignored.  I want to try to do the same for many other aspects that few people take seriously until it’s too late. <br><br>\r\nADVICE/TAILORING? <br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThis listing is what I have cultivated over the years and have used successfully to make both large and small systems “globally ready” and successful for the largest business unit of a 36.8 billion dollar company (for both internet and internal facing solutions).

Modules are design-time units with fixed domains and hidden design decisions. Modules particularly promote systematic correctness analyses. However, these beneficial properties disappear once the modules have been integrated into and deployed on target machines. For embedded systems that run within tight real-time constraints, modules may even hamper integration tests and fault analyses, due to the inaccessibility of modules' internals. Hence, for an HW/SW-integration platform of an X-by-wire eCar, we developed HDCs in order to non-intrusively trace and test the behavior of single and multiple modules (HDCs) integrated into one or more platform nodes.\r\n\r\nHDCs transfer modules from design-time entities to runtime entities. HDCs can be tested in integrated systems during field operation, without code instrumentation and probing effects. For this purpose, the HDC runtime environment captures data structures that flow within and between HDCs for one macro cycle (e.g. lasting 10 ms) of the time-triggered system; each macro cycle anew. An HDC can access only internal and parametric data structures. The probe is the only HDC with full access to all data structures, including its own. Because they are half-open for the probe and half-closed for all other HDCs, we call these data capsules hemispheric.\r\n\r\nIn the presentation, we will first reveal requirements behind HDCs originating from an industry study on an HW/SW-integration platform providing safety services to a fail-operational eCar (www.projekt-race.de/en). We will then sketch tests that can be run for HDCs. This motivates the design of an HDC system and its effect on the application and implementation of HDCs in general and the probe in particular, which we will describe afterwards. We will critically reflect on our experiences with HDCs during development, in the lab and in the field, as well as on the applicability of HDCs to event-triggered, object-oriented systems as basis for discussion.","notes":"","abstract":"A Hemispheric Data Capsule (HDC) is a runtime entity of a module with externalized data structures.

The insights to be gained from data are endless. In light of this a new paradigm of the real-time communication between things has emerged, in which the quality of life of citizens in dense urban environments is increased through the security of using big data and cloud technology. Future cities are likely to feature thousands of strategically placed sensors that would record everything from air pressure and temperature to microbial content, and the data would be relayed instantly to the smart devices of actively participating citizens, who will make critical contributions to urban planning, reducing pollution, and making the best use of finite resources.\r\nThe proposed solution is the mobile connectivity that provides the network coverage wherever devices may roam. Secure cellular connection together with SIM cards and endpoints can be easily managed in real-time via the intuitive user-interface or directly from the customer’s software application via an easy-to-integrate API. Key features, development and implementation stages, as well as use cases will be discussed.  \r\nThe talk includes a lot of real working IoT use cases and their potential impact on our daily life. Their focus direct towards a more practical improvement of the quality of our life. Attendees will explore what is the potential impact of IoT, what real IoT use cases was implemented in Germany, how can we increase the quality of life with the IoT.","notes":"As I now reflect back on my working experience and lots of conferences, I can personally attest to the wide range of benefits that international communication provides for IT development nowadays and the insight brought about through cooperating with techs from all over the globe.

These IoT devices can certainly connect through a lot of different ways, but in this talk we will focus on cellular connectivity.  \r\nObviously, other receptions are always limited to the access point, and also dependent on network and device configurations. Cellular has reception everywhere without any maintenance effort from the customer side, so with telecom access a large-scale investigation is possible. Given the ubiquity of sim based devices, cellular solutions can achieve an unbelievable level of coverage in both space and time for observing any events.\r\nIf we take IoT and wanna use it in a large scale for example in agriculture industry in Africa, we have to built a large suitable, secure and cost-efficient architecture/system. As low-energy network does not exist there and can provide connectivity only on one site, so the communication with the combine on the field will be always insecure.\r\nEven SMS can play a role as an intermediate solution and help with device distribution or middleware as GSM network always can be used, even if internet is not available, which makes it reliable and persistent channel for IoT connectivity.\r\nThis talk is more focused on use cases with real-time or time-critical services, of course it can impact economic and security.\r\n\r\nSnowy regards from Germany, \r\nKarina","created_at":"2017-01-31T14:44:57.109Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T14:44:57.109Z"}]}},{"id":8010,"submission":{"id":8010,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-13T18:34:46.858Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T18:27:20.251Z","additional_info":"N/A, I was speaking at the last Saturn conference in San Diego","rating":10.8,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":[],"profile":{"name":"Alexander von Zitzewitz","bio":"Alexander von Zitzewitz is founder, managing director of the company and CEO of the US subsidiary.

One device sends data to other device that can use this data.IoT can make the existing healthcare system more efficient in terms of Time, Energy and Cost.\r\nBy embedding IoT devices into existing medical equipment, patients can be monitored more effectively. Data obtained from these devices can be used to make proactive decisions.\r\n•\tThe Learning:\r\n•\tMassive impact on life and business.\r\n•\tHuge incoming data from connected devices and ensuring devices can hold data securely.\r\n•\tChallenges in managing enormous volume of data.\r\n•\tQuality of data and power consumptions.\r\nThe Act:\r\n•\tHigh performance data management systems.\r\n•\tInnovations in sensor technologies and setting up secure networks.\r\n\r\nMarket Trend and Prospect: \r\n•\tThe Internet of Things will be the largest device market in the world. It is estimated that by 2019 it will be more than double the size of the smartphone, PC, tablet, connected car, and the wearable market combined.\r\n•\tThe IoT will result in $1.7 trillion in value added to the global economy in 2019. This includes hardware, software, installation costs, management services, and economic value added from realized IoT efficiencies.\r\n•\tDevice shipments will reach 6.7 billion in 2019 for a five-year CAGR of 61%. Revenue from hardware sales will be only $50 billion or 8% of the total revenue from IoT-specific efforts, as software makers and infrastructure companies will earn the lion's share.\r\n•\tThe enterprise sector will lead the IoT, accounting for 46% of device shipments this year, but that share will decline as the government and home sectors gain momentum. By 2019, government will be the leading sector for IoT device shipments.\r\n•\tThe main benefit of growth in the IoT will be increased efficiency and lower costs. The IoT promises increased efficiency within the home, city, and workplace by giving control to the user. However, many are hesitant to use devices as security problems are still an issue.\r\n\r\nCase study:\r\nSmart Hospitals Using Internet of Things (IoT)\r\nMost of the time, due to negligence of hospital staff, excessive number of patients or inattentiveness of relatives it may happen that saline bottle is not monitored properly and it may lead to cause heart attack due to “AIR EMBOLISM”. In a hospital, numbers of electrical equipments (fan, lights) are more so energy is more. Thus, it is important to use electricity as per the requirement. Thus, in this paper we have proposed a system which include combination of sensor technology and Internet of Things (IoT).Using this system one can control switch of the electricity and monitor level of the saline bottle from distant position.\r\nIoT Testing\r\n\r\nAbout MQTT Protocol\r\nAccording to the specifications, MQTT is client/server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol. It is lightweight, open, simple, and designed so as to be easy to implement. These characteristics make it ideal for use in many situations, including constrained environments such as communications in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) contexts, where a small code footprint is required and network bandwidth is at a premium.\r\n\r\nClient/Server Message Pattern\r\nMQTT uses publish/subscribe model to deliver all messages to interested clients. In this model, a publishing client (publisher) does not send requests directly to each receiving client. Instead, it publishes the message to the server known as broker, which, in its turn, forwards data to the clients that need them.\r\nThis way the publisher can send only messages to the specific address. Otherwise, it would have to update the list of clients constantly and send multiple messages on every update. This may be impossible for publishers with low processing power or limited Internet connection.\r\nClients, who want to receive data, subscribe to the broker. They subscription model allows them to subscribe to specific topics and, thus, filter out the messages they do not need.\r\n Both the publishers and clients send a Connect message to work with the broker.\r\nThe described solution also allows the broker to send messages if the publisher has connection issues, or if the client is offline when a message is published. The broker stores the message and sends it to all newly connected subscribers and a Will message is sent when the publisher has connection issues.\r\n\r\nWill Message\r\nMQTT ensures the message delivery even if the network issues happen, or if the publisher suddenly goes offline. This mechanism is known as a Will message. The Will message is sent to the broker when the publisher connects, and it is published in case the publisher disconnects without sending the Disconnect message. If this happens, the Will message will be posted, and the broker will send it to all subscribed clients.\r\n\r\nMQTT Testing in Ready! API\r\nReady! API can act both as a publisher and as a client for MQTT broker. We can use it to create functional and load tests.\r\n\r\nMQTT Functional Testing\r\nTo test the broker's functionality, we need to create a SoapUI NG test that uses the MQTT-related test steps:\r\nTest Step\t                               Description\r\nPublish Using MQTT\t               Establishes MQTT connection and publishes the message specified in test step properties.\r\nReceive MQTT Message\t       Subscribes to an MQTT topic and waits for the first message posted to it.\r\nDrop MQTT Connection\t       Simulates the publisher disconnecting from the server, either in the normal way by sending a Disconnect message, or unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nMQTT Load Testing\r\nTo see how MQTT broker performs under heavy load, We need to create a load test for it in LoadUI NG. We first create an MQTT test case in SoapUI NG, and then create a load test that simulates this test case with dozens and hundreds of virtual users running on a locally or remote machines. \r\n","notes":"","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices connected to each other.IoT can make the existing healthcare system more efficient in terms of Time, Energy and Cost.By embedding IoT devices to medical equipment, patients can be monitored effectively and proactive decisions can be made.\n\n","audience_level":"All","talk_format":"DEV@SATURN Talk (15 minutes)"},"ratings":[{"id":29657,"submission_id":9260,"value":1,"comments":"","created_at":"2017-02-10T11:22:04.343Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T11:22:04.343Z","user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"}}],"feedback":[{"id":4424,"submission_id":9260,"talk_id":17577,"user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"},"body":"Hello Shravan and Muthumeena, \r\n\r\nThank you for your submission. We have received a record-high number of submissions this year. There were many excellent proposals, more than we could accept due to the limited number of spots. I hope you can join us at SATURN May 1-4 in Denver. I also hope you can submit again to SATURN 2018. With that in mind, I'd like to give you some feedback on your proposal. \r\n\r\n1. SATURN is focused on software design and attracts mostly software architects and seasoned developers from industry. You can make your talk description shorter and more objective. For example, I would shorten significantly or remove the information about market trend and prospect. That's too much data for a talk *description*. \r\n\r\n2. I'm not sure what do you mean by \"The Act\".\r\n\r\n3. In the talk description you say \"in this paper we have proposed a system which...\"  Please keep in mind there is no paper submission for SATURN. You only need to submit a proposal for a presentation to be given to an audience that is primarily composed by practitioners in industry and government. \r\n\r\n4. It seems there's a broken sentence that starts with \"IoT Testing\".\r\n\r\n5. It's not quite clear whether the proposal is a case study (experience report) or a general tech talk about IoT or IoT testing. If it's an experience report, then the focus should be on the important design decisions and lessons learned (what worked, what you would do differently). \r\n\r\n6. Still related to the unclear nature of the talk... the description uses a lot of space describing MQTT and related development/testing frameworks. Explaining MQTT is a goal for this presentation? \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-10T11:22:00.175Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T11:22:00.175Z"}]}},{"id":8166,"submission":{"id":8166,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-16T20:02:52.941Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T18:27:20.417Z","additional_info":"Video to presentation at 2016 surge conference is no longer publicly available","rating":20.6,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["cloud computing","chaos"],"profile":{"name":"Joel Tosi","bio":"Coaching and pairing within and across teams on how to leverage new technologies to drive product learning.","twitter":"joeltosi","company":"","url":"http://www.devjam.com","shirt_size":"Men's M","email":"joel.p.tosi@gmail.com","location":"Unknown"},"talk":{"title":"Intro to Chaos - Chaos Engineering in your world","description":"Learn what Chaos Engineering is and why it is relevant.\r\n\r\nLearn how to start using Chaos Engineering without breaking production\r\n\r\nLearn how to grow your understanding of complex systems and build resiliency in your products\r\n\r\n30 minutes","notes":"Just a whiteboard and a projector","abstract":"Chaos Engineering from Netflix is more than just randomly breaking stuff.

Performance also impacts the usability and user adoption rate after the system goes live. However, performance issues usually show up during the later phases of the project or during system implementation such as Load / Stress Test and / or User Acceptance Test (UAT) when data volume scales up. The probable cause is a lack of non-functional requirements on performance at an early stage of the architectural design. This presentation is to conceive and show how to salvage a troubled project with performance issues that focuses on performance and storage trade-offs, and how Architecture Analysis Tradeoff Method (ATAM) is used to leverage the performance and storage trade-offs. The specific tailored solution I wanted to share is to move data aggregation and sorting from backend database to Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time and be accessed over http through query parameters. I will also discuss performance concerns from end-to-end in systems the deal with heavy data aggregation and sorting using real-world implementation examples. Perspectives on how to address performance concerns and turn around a troubled project in a very short period of time will also be elaborated.\r\n\r\nIntroduction and Architecture Quality Attributes (5 minutes) \r\nPerformance and Storage Trade-offs by example (15 minutes) \r\nArchitectural Dynamics, Challenges, and Impacts (5 minutes) \r\nQ&A (5 minutes)\r\n","notes":"The take away for this presentation will be the practical techniques to salvage projects with severe system performance issues. This presentation is based on my real-world experiences in salvaging two multiple-million dollar projects in a very short period. Neither project conducted architecture quality attributes workshop (QAW). The performance issues were so severe that the projects were subject to be cancelled. The root of causes were extensive data aggregation with heavy computation and sorting on a low-end databases. One of the two projects simply tried to reuse a simple mobile application architecture with 2 search criteria and less than 100 thousand records on a PostgreSQL to a full blown application with 100 million records with over 20 search criteria. When performance issues appeared at UAT, $2 million dollars were already invested in the project. I will present a quick turnaround options including tailored solutions ranging from increasing hardware / network capacity, database tuning / query optimization, API optimization, to the implementation of Solr or Elasticsearch to address the performance issue. The examples I will use in the presentation will be performance and storage trade-offs that leverage the Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time. The architectural dynamics, challenges, and impacts such as Solr indexing time impact to the existing ETL process and PaaS issues will also be presented. The practical knowledge of this presentation will benefit architects and business decision makers to understand the important of Architecture Quality Attributes and how to address performance issues with tailored solutions.\r\n\r\nI think the presentation belongs to Track 3: Other topics interest - Addressing quality attribute concerns, such as performance, availability, usability, security, and interoperability\r\n","abstract":"Why do so many projects have system performance issues at a later stage of implementation?

I updated my Talk Description as follows, but was not able to edit the original description.  Any help I can get from you to revise the original submission?\r\n---------\r\nPerformance is one of the critical architecture quality attributes. The performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a non-functional requirement that is used as an acceptance criteria for almost every project / system. Performance SLA also impacts the usability and user adoption rate after the system goes live. However, performance issues usually show up during the later phases of the project or during system implementation such as Load / Stress Test and / or User Acceptance Test (UAT) when data volume scales up. The probable cause is a lack of defined architecture quality attributes and vague non-functional requirements on performance at the early stage of the project such as architectural design. This presentation is to conceive and show how to salvage a troubled project with performance SLA issues that focuses on performance and storage trade-offs, and how Architecture Analysis Tradeoff Method (ATAM) is used to leverage the performance and storage trade-offs. The specific tailored solution I wanted to share is to move data aggregation and sorting from backed end database to Solr or Elasticsearch as an indexing service so that data aggregation and sorting can be indexed ahead of time and be access over http through query parameters. I will also discuss detailed issue resolution approaches to address performance concerns from end-to-end, real-world implementation on performance and storage trade-offs to turn the project around in a very short period of time to meet the performance SLA.\r\n\r\nIntroduction and Architecture Quality Attributes?

I think the talk description uses the term SLA inaccurately. SLA is a document that may specify perfomance requirements, among other things. I'd argue that the majority of software systems out there do not have such a document in effect. So, saying \"The performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a non-functional requirement that is used as an acceptance criteria for almost every project / system\" is an overstatement to me. But if you drop the term \"Service Level Agreement (SLA)\", the sentence sounds quite valid. \r\n\r\n2. Likewise, the SLA document doesn't impact usability. It's performance that affects usability. \r\n\r\n3. The talk description uses quite some space to discuss the general importance of performance as a quality attribute requirement. I believe that's not the focus of the talk, but as is the description becomes less interesting, because many SATURN attendees are well aware that performance requirements are important. The title and description could be more specific and clearly indicate what kind of performance optimization is discussed. In other words, I suggest you say in the title and abstract what specific kind of performance solution you'll present. \r\n\r\n4. You say \"The probable cause is a lack of defined architecture quality attributes and vague non-functional requirements on performance at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\" It's not clear to me what is \"defined architecture quality attributes\" versus \" non-functional requirements on performance.\"  Also, I think it would make more sense to say \"at an early stage of the architectural design\" instead of \"at the early stage of the project such as architectural design.\"\r\n\r\n5. The phrase \"I will also discuss detailed issue resolution approaches to address performance concerns from end-to-end\"  sounds very general and hence too ambitious. Maybe you should be more specific, such as \"... performance concerns from end-to-end in systems that deal with text search on indexed data sets. \r\n\r\n6. The term \"storage trade-offs\" is not clear. Is is about tradeoffs regarding the choice of infrastructure used for persisting data? Maybe RDBMS vs NoSQL databases? Maybe tradeoffs related to Lucene indexing options? \r\n\r\n7. SATURN attendees are interested in technologies, tools, frameworks that have been used successfully. So, in an unbiased fashion, you could try to mention tools such as profilers and performance monitors that you have used. Learning about the experience of others with such tools may raise the interest in your talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"sorting from back**end database to Solr \"\r\n\r\n- \"and be access*ed* over http\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T14:24:31.844Z"},{"id":3747,"submission_id":8268,"talk_id":15740,"user":{"name":"George Fairbanks","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/7617/George-Fairbanks.png","email":"gf@georgefairbanks.com"},"body":"I'm drawn to this talk because of the specifics of the case studies as described in the Notes section.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. Today Software Architecture is taught at many undergrad and graduate academic programs in the US and abroad. Also, there are many professional training classes available. Some are vendor agnostic (such as the SEI courses), others are offered by vendors, such as Microsoft and Oracle. In your presentation, do you consider taking classes on software architecture an effective possible step in the roadmap? \r\n\r\n2. The software architect should also have a clear understanding of quality attributes, such as modifiability, availability, performance, and security. He/she should know how to elicit and document quality attribute requirements, because these requirements are the most important architecture drivers. \r\n\r\n3. The architect should also understand that architecture consists of multiple structures, which are documented in multiple views. He/she should know how to communicate the multi-view architecture effectively. Many times this communication involves diagrams, so the architect should know UML or know how to create and use an informal diagram notation consistently. \r\n\r\n4. A question that could be discussed in your presentation: is there value in pursuing one of the different available software architecture certifications? \r\n\r\n5. The architect should also know how to create, document, and evaluate an architecture. \r\n\r\n6. Years ago people at the SEI software architecture group engaged in a discussion about the duties, skills and knowledge of an architect. One of the results of that discussion is on [this web page](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/research/previousresearch/duties.cfm). It might have useful information for your presentation. \r\n\r\n7. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n8.

If they ignore, the CI build will detect and report the issue. For more strict design rules, you also have the option to block code commit to the git or svn repository.

Different nodes on different machines try to communicate with each other as well different devices and controllers do. \r\nThese IoT devices can certainly connect through a lot of different ways, but in this talk I focus on cellular connectivity. Obviously, other receptions are always limited to the access point, and also dependent on network and device configurations. Cellular has reception everywhere without any maintenance effort from the customer side, so with telecom access a large-scale investigation is possible. Given the ubiquity of sim based IoT devices, cellular solutions can achieve an unbelievable level of coverage in both space and time for observing any events.\r\nIf we take IoT and wanna use it in a large scale for example in agriculture industry in Africa, we have to built a suitable large architecture. As low-energy network does not exist there and can provide connectivity only on one site, so the communication with the combine on the field will be always insecure. Even SMS can play a role as an intermediate solution and help with device distribution or middleware. GSM network always can be used, even if internet is not available, which makes it reliable and persistent channel for IoT connectivity.\r\nIn my talk I include not only an agriculture, but also e-health, logistic and alarm system cases, with journey map and code demonstration.\r\n\r\nCheers, Karina","created_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T14:13:17.104Z"}]}},{"id":7175,"submission":{"id":7175,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2016-12-15T21:32:52.833Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T18:27:19.694Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-RBaNTGJSk&list=PLvk9Yh_MWYuwTYjxOqjzOlVmFFHvN3Yp7&index=1&t=3s","rating":62.5,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["pipelines","scale","design","devops","30-min tech talk"],"profile":{"name":"Avantika Mathur","bio":"Avan (Avantika) Mathur is the Product Manager for ElectricFlow.

Obtain tips and tools for ensuring your pipelines and DevOps infrastructure have the right architecture and feature-set to support your software production as it scales, while also ensuring manageability, governance, security, and compliance. \r\n\r\nLearn best practices for how to:\r\n\r\n1) Plan for scale: how to project for the types of performance indicators/vectors you’d need to scale across.\r\n2) How to design of your pipeline and supporting infrastructure and operations (such as data retention, artifact retrieval, monitoring, etc.).\r\n3) Design your pipeline workflows and processes to allow reusability and standardization across the organization, while also enabling flexibility to support the needs of specific teams/apps.\r\n4) Design your pipeline in a way that enables fast rollout- easy onboarding thousands of applications, across hundreds of teams\r\n5) Incorporate security access controls, approval gates and compliance checks as part of your pipeline and have them standard across all releases\r\n6) Ensure your architecture support HA, DR and business continuity.\r\n","notes":"This is designed to be a joint session with Electric Cloud CTO, Anders Wallgren: Anders Wallgren is chief technology officer at Electric Cloud.

Business leaders who rely on information to make complex decisions in real time could not succeed as desired because technology could not cope up with their needs till today. This decades’ long wait has finally come to an end thanks to Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Analytics. Especially Real Time Analytics powered by In-Memory Computing (IMC) offers a way out from this rut. Further still, a truly disruptive hybrid model that shrewdly mixes both, “Relying on the past to predict the future” and “Real Time Analytics” is a fool proof approach for digital era analytics solutions. \r\n \r\nBy embedding a select array of Artificial Intelligence techniques from cognitive research arena right into the core algorithms and using state of the art research projects such as SRI, CNTK and Google Tensor Flow, how we can leverage In Memory Computing to address predictive business analytics issues will be addressed in this session.\r\n\r\nHow to address complex and strategic decision needs in real time?\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nBy flexing and blending a variety of technologies within the realm of In Memory Computing, we can address all the three types of decisions, including Operational, Tactical and Strategic. While operational and tactical decisions tap into existing datamarts and datastores which house transactional, structured data, strategic decision making goes beyond the traditional stores and rely heavily on real time, unstructured data influx. \r\n\r\nReal time strategic decision making in digital era is impossible unless we shatter today’s speed and scale barriers. For speed, we can leverage In Memory Computing that tackles both latent and live streams of data. For planet scale, as the volume is huge and expected to grow exponentially, an on-demand, scalable infrastructure should be erected to contain the catastrophes. As strategic decisions need to factor in various parameters, an ensemble of machine-learning algorithms are employed to crunch data, to classify the outliers and recommend meaningful actions to deal with a specific problem at hand. An enormous number of simulations, trained models and tests are applied to the data which has been acquired and prepared before passed on to the intelligent analytics engine to arrive at precise real-time business decisions.\r\n\r\nApplied IMC Use case - Customer Intimacy \r\n==================================\r\n\r\nAs the world is becoming more complex by the moment, strategic decision making in real time is also becoming extremely difficult and is compounded by the speed and scale with which information is generated and consumed. IMC furthers the decision-making process by employing cutting-edge tools, and conceiving and deploying disruptive models to address customer concerns. When it comes to meaningful engagement with customers, relying on heuristics and instinctive impulses for strategic making is no longer reliable, in today’s rapidly changing digital landscape.\r\n\r\nThis session is designed to shed some light on a practical use case on how to enhance customer intimacy using In-Memory Computing for business analytics.\r\n\r\n\r\n","notes":"Functions and Algorithms\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThe driving force behind the use case is ‘enhancing customer experience’. With this is in mind, every customer interaction is funneled for use in a sentiment analysis. By examining every chat, email, tweet, voice transcript and logs, the attitudes, emotions, likes, preferences, habits behind the interactions are analysed using the following (indicative) machine and deep learning algorithms:\r\n\t\r\nNaïve Bayes\r\nMax ENT\r\nSVM\r\nCNN, HMM, GMM, \r\nDNN, RNN, LSTM\r\n\r\nArchitecture behind Real-Time In- Memory Analytics \r\n==========================================\t\r\nThe following  architecture principles are applied in Predictive Real-Time Business Analytics :\r\n\r\n* Real Time, In Memory Process.\r\n* Loose coupling.\r\n* Interoperability.\r\n* Modularity.\r\n* Scalability with built in CAPS.\r\n* Cloud Centric.\r\n* Mobile Centric.\r\n\r\nBy design Highly stable, open source products are plugged into the solution.\r\n","abstract":"Till today technology has failed business leaders miserably who wanted information to make complex decisions in real time.

Likewise, I think it's an overstatement to say that AI and real-time analytics are the single largest contributor to customer relations in history. What about the Internet? And another example of what sounds to me like an overstatement: \"Real time strategic decision making in digital era is impossible unless we shatter today’s speed and scale barriers\".\r\n\r\nI have a few suggestions from the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program:\r\n\r\n1) Description: The third paragraph under \"Disruptive Intelligence\" is one long sentence.

I think you should simplify the motivation part of the description and focus more on the technical presentation. And it turns out the technical part of the talk is a little vague. Are you going to talk about general solutions to real-time analytics and IMC? Or about a specific (of set of) solution/design/technology/framework/tool? Or is it a case study? \r\n\r\n3) Description: It's not clear what attendees will learn. For example, in the Notes you mention \"Architecture behind Real-Time In-Memory Analytics\".

I'm very interested in the topic of software quality, but I'm sorry to say that I'm finding your description a little perplexing.\r\n\r\nThe title is confusing me.  My initial thought was that you were saying \"Software Quality Attributes Considered Harmful.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, reading the introduction paragraph makes me think you are actually saying is \"Poor Quality is Risky\", or perhaps \"A Little Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing\" because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly.\r\n\r\nBy \"essentially complex\" do you mean \"necessarily complex\"?  i.e.  This is the level of complexity that is needed as a minimum, you cannot go any simpler than this?\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"essentially complex\" do you actually mean that the model is complex by nature.  Complexity is often seen as a undesirable, , so complex nature could be a bad thing.\r\n\r\nReading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base.  Am I right in thinking that this is the \"Essentially complex quality model.\"  Since you are presenting it, then I assume it must be a good thing.  The title and introduction don't make this clear.\r\n\r\nAlso, you begin the second paragraph referring to \"some at the SEI.\"  You then refer to \"We\".  Is the \"We\" the people at the SEI, or are you referring to the people ClearSpecs Enterprises? \r\n\r\nI hope you can understand my confusion and can help me clarify my understanding.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\n\r\nGed","created_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T17:06:25.248Z"},{"id":3023,"submission_id":6786,"talk_id":12965,"user":{"name":"David Gelperin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/58dc7fd3fec8a0f1410e81c70809f012?s=500","email":"david@clearspecs.com"},"body":"Sorry for the confusion. \r\n\r\nI changed the title to \"Qualities are Very Complex\" because that is my message.  I am using \"essential complexity\" as Fred Brooks does.  DNA, the London subway, and Einstein's theory of relativity are each more complex than a triangle or benzene molecule.  \r\n\r\n\"Essential complexity\" is neither bad nor good.  It is a scalar characteristic, like weight.  By definition, if I build a model or solve a problem, the essential complexity of the thing being modeled or the problem being solved determines the essential complexity of an accurate model or an effective solution.\r\n\r\nWhile understanding higher levels of essential complexity is very difficult, simplistic understanding can be dangerous.  If the software in a self-driving car is simplistic, people will die needlessly.  \r\n\r\n“A Simplistic Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing” because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly. – Yes   Complexity is often seen as undesirable, [just like too much weight], so complex nature could be a bad thing – No [Human intelligence is not a bad thing, but unnecessary complexity is a bad thing.]  Reading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base. Am I right in thinking that this is the “Essentially complex quality model.” – Yes\r\n\r\nHere is the rewrite:  Qualities are Very Complex\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of a project, you should identify likely project risks.  Quality goals may be among them.  These goals must be defined, achieved, and verified.  We show that current quality models are simplistic and then describe a quality model of sufficient complexity.\r\n\r\nWe highlight the features of a quality knowledge base that outlines over 60 quality attributes, their support and conflict relationships, and their tactics for goal definition, achievement, and verification.  This knowledge base is freely available and enables you to identify your quality goals and strategies at the beginning of a project.  If you don’t use it, you may waste time and increase project risk.\r\n\r\nImprovement suggestions much appreciated.

I think we need techniques that make specification, design, and validation of quality goals simple and practical. IMO, a “quality model of sufficient complexity” doesn’t sound very enticing to the agile, framework-oriented developer of today.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with all but the word \"simple\".  The set of quality attributes and some individual attributes like safety and security are NOT simple (just like DNA).  Some attributes have entire books written about them. Their specification, design, and verification is NOT simple.\r\n\r\nI understand that I am \"selling\" complexity (reality?), but the earth is not flat and orbits are not circular.  Simplistic models of quality attributes will never produce predictable quality.\r\n\r\nAs to enticing the Agile crowd, there are many problems.  I have written that \"Agile is a Quality Antipattern\" and \"Fixing Agile\".  \"Pure\" agile is simplistic.  It can work great as long as you ignore quality goals.  These goals don't fit the Agile paradigm because they should be identified and specified early and achieved and verified in every iteration.  In surveys of current Agile practice, over 50% of the responders don't following any coding standards.  These Agile projects build huge quality debt starting from the first increment.

Okay, not really, but you are providing the equivalent as your user experience. This hurts your <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/responsive-design-ranking-factor-228464\">SEO potential</a>, and drives traffic away from your site.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s get a quick rundown on what responsive web design actually means within the context of an ordinary website. This definition from <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2013/05/what-is-responsive-web-design.html\">Small Business Trends</a> sums it up nicely:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Responsive Web design is an approach whereby a designer creates a Web page that “responds to” or resizes itself depending on the type of device it is being seen through. That could be an oversized desktop computer monitor, a laptop, a 10-inch tablet, a 7-inch tablet, or a 4-inch smartphone screen.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>So with this in mind, let’s take a look at hypothetical look at a website on a few different devices.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=690%2C224&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"multiple-devices\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=600%2C195&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=720%2C234&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\r\n<p>Guys…. Stop thinking about coffee and let’s focus!</p>\r\n<p>Maybe the importance of this isn’t really seeping in and maybe you’re more of a numbers person… Let’s try another route.</p>\r\n<p>80% of internet users own a smartphone per <a href=\"http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/\">Smart Insights</a>. According to <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/why_marketers_should_keep_sending_you_emails\">MicKinsey &amp; Company</a>, Google says 61% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site they had trouble accessing and 40% visit a competitor’s site instead. A report by <a href=\"http://visual.ly/mobile-web-usage-2015-and-onwards\">Wolfgang Jaegel</a> found that 91% of mobile users say that access to content is very important.</p>\r\n<p>In all seriousness, it is a big deal if your site does not work on mobile devices. Think about the kittens!!  And if you’re thinking, “there aren’t THAT many devices out there,” and “it can’t be THAT hard to be responsive,” think about those kittens one final time.</p>\r\n<p>I am sure there is a number out there on the internet waiting to be found telling us how many devices are web capable, and <a href=\"https://www.perfectomobile.com/list-of-supported-devices\">I am also sure it’s large</a>. Keep in mind each device is designed differently, with different software requirements, default browsers, and different hardware specs. That means, as a developer, no matter what you’re building, you will likely find yourself daydreaming of how many kittens you’d prefer were being hit in the face, while you debug the fifth CSS error you encounter in Safari, that never existed in Chrome&#8230;Sorry, that got a bit personal.</p>\r\n<p>As much as I would like to believe my iPhone is having an identity crisis, that’s not the actual case. There are standards out there for web design (sometimes sketchy ones), that are intended to help developers and browsers work within boundaries that help to simplify things. And I know what you’re thinking.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you, mobile gods. We’re saved!</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"design-gods\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\r\n<p>But we haven’t quite saved those kitties just yet.</p>\r\n<p>You may still be thinking, “Why do you need to know all this?”</p>\r\n<p>If you’re a business owner looking to increase your audience and you haven’t taken the responsive route, that should be the first thing on your to-do list. Online shopping is already a huge trend and still growing at this rate. If you’re trying to get your blog out there over a product, what better place for someone to read that than on their device while in the restroom? I mean really… we’ve all done it…</p>\r\n<p>If you’re looking to get a better <a href=\"http://www.marketpath.com/digital-marketing-insights/8-reasons-to-have-a-responsive-web-design-infographic\">return on your investment (ROI)</a>, responsiveness is another way to do that. If you do not have a fully responsive design, you are throwing away potential page views and potential dollars pulled in from your mobile shoppers.</p>\r\n<p>Now onto saving all those kittens!</p>\r\n<p>If you’re not familiar with WordPress or its standards, there are these things called themes. I mean, to take it directly from the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes\">WordPress Codex</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. These files are called template files. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>To put it simply, a theme is the look and feel of your site via functionality and design. It’s the idea that you can do anything with your content within the provided templates and have a consistent and clean flow.</p>\r\n<div><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=690%2C376&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"elegant-themes\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?w=970&amp;ssl=1 970w, https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=600%2C327&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=720%2C392&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p>Popular WordPress themes from Elegant Themes</p></div>\r\n<p>There are thousands of themes out there to pick from. Whether you’re building a store front, a restaurant front and menu, a non-profit donation location, a blog, or an educational site, there is something out there for you. There are many free options, usually offered through the CMS that’s been installed, and paid options that tend to be found via outside sources.</p>\r\n<p>So get to searching for the responsive theme that fits your needs, either through <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a> or through a seller like <a href=\"https://themeforest.net\">ThemeForest</a>. The kittens will thank you.</p>\r\n<p>If you go searching and nothing seems to catch your eye (insert joke about cats chasing the red dot of doom), there are always custom themes. This is the option for businesses that are looking for a specific look or functionality that they can’t find anywhere else. Being unique can be a huge benefit to a business with the right design and implementation. This is a costlier option but usually has a higher turn around on traffic and offers more options for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and design tactics. Marketing teams usually love this option!</p>\r\n<p>That’s it, that’s all you have to do.</p>\r\n<p>As developers, we have to do much much MUCH more to make something like a custom theme or purchased theme modifications (maybe I’ll write about that in the future for all the dev-heads out there wanting to help the kitties), but as a website owner using WordPress, that’s all you have to do; find a theme that is responsive. You can look more into the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack plugin</a> to help with SEO as well (yet, again, maybe another post for the future).</p>\r\n<p>So get out there and start saving those kittens! I believe you will make the right decision!</p>\r\n<p>Also, if you need some emergency kittens, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmrgencyKittens\">go here.</a> You’re welcome.</p>\r\n","notes":"This talk is great for those who are just starting to learn CSS or web design, but still helpful to those who have been creating sites for a few years.

A lot of focus is put on the *initial development* aspect, before the first delivery, and little attention is given to the *maintenance phase* of the software system. With more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models, creating long-lived Internet systems that aren’t forgiving to downtimes or cumbersome data migrations, maintenance becomes much more important and critical to the overall design of the system than the initial development.\r\n\r\nAgile offers a different, *Emergent* method to design software, with small iterations that, when combined with continuous delivery and learning, results in a design that’s much more adaptive to changing requirements. Taken to the extreme, we shorten the initial development phase to a minimum and focus mostly on iterative maintenance steps. \r\n\r\nHowever, the conditions required to facilitate Emergent Design require that the development team refrain from over-engineering and YAGNI violations - two problems that are prevalent in the software industry, especially with less-experienced engineers. Outside-In Development is a methodology that helps us focus on the Semantics rather the Mechanics of our software, protect us from YAGNI violations, and thus facilitate Emergent Design. Practicing TDD helps us implement this methodology in the scope of a commercial software project, by helping us cultivate a Beginner’s Mind towards software design.","notes":"I will start by describing the gap between how engineers usually view software design and how Internet-scale systems actually evolves. I will then make the point that software isn’t like bridges, cars or other “classical” engineering projects. I will use the biological analogy, talking about software as a garden and how we always build on existing system state, and how software engineering is an ongoing, evolving effort. I will claim that a paradigm shift is needed towards wide adoption of Emergent Design.\r\n\r\nNext, I will explain why traditional software engineering training is deleterious to this paradigm shift, with people learning to think about static, rather than evolving, software design, and are taught more about the mechanics of software (design patterns, technology) and less about the semantics (creating the right abstractions). I will discuss Outside-In Development and explain how it helps stick to the YAGNI principle, and how this facilitates Emergent Design. I will explain that it’s hard to adopt outside-in due to the way engineers are trained and how cultivating a Beginner’s Mind helps us put aside these problems and achieve outside-in.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will explain how practicing TDD helps us cultivate the Beginner’s Mind and facilitate outside-in, with test-first serving as the outside user of a system or subsystem, and how the Refactoring phase of TDD helps design emerge.\r\n\r\n### Presentation History:\r\nInitially developed in 2014 as an internal Wix.com tech talk.

My talk, and to a greater extent my epiphany, has to do with our fallacies as software engineers, their origins, and how TDD, by helping us cultivate a beginner's mind, can aid in getting rid or taming these fallacies, which include YAGNI violation, over-engineering, pattern obsession and so on. \r\n\r\nWhile this talk doesn't relate to software architecture in the common sense (topology, microservices, databasesm etc), it does deal with how adhering to TDD as a methodology is beneficial for software organizations that develop web-scale, long-lived Internet systems, as was our experience at Wix.com.","created_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T21:27:33.203Z"},{"id":2651,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Shai, Thanks for the update!

I don't understand what you mean by \"more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models\" in practice. Do you mean more development organizations are creating their software solutions as SaaS? Is it true for the enterprise? Or do you mean more organizations are using various SaaS solutions, such as dockerhub and github? \r\n\r\n2. I think maintainability is an important quality attribute requirement for software systems in general. If you use patterns and tactics that promote maintainability, I think you are giving attention to the maintenance phase. In the first paragraph, it seems you are saying that BDUF does not focus on maintainability. I don't think that's the problem with BDUF. The problem is that you design beyond what's known at the beginning. If you start coding earlier, initial releases will give you incredible understanding of runtime/maintainability issues that help to drive downstream design in the right direction. \r\n\r\n3. Here's what wikipedia says about Emergent Design: \"With emergent design, a development organization starts delivering functionality and lets the design emerge. Development will take a piece of functionality A and implement it using best practices and proper test coverage and then move on to delivering functionality B. Once B is built, or while it is being built, the organization will look at what A and B have in common and refactor out the commonality, allowing the design to emerge. This process continues as the organization continually delivers functionality.\"\r\nI'm not sure this is your interpretation of emergent design. In any case, it is important to reflect about some points. Is this approach good in all cases? If not, what's the criteria to decide when to use it? Aren't there tradeoffs related to following emergent design? What kinds of design decisions are in the scope of this approach? Does emergent design prevent the use of techniques (such as DDD) that ask you to design beyond the scope of a scrum sprint functionality? \r\n\r\n4. From the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program, I think the title+description don't make it clear what the talk is about. The title makes you think it's about TDD. The description may make you think the talk is about Emergent Design and/or the outside-in development approach. \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6. In the description, consider adding what participants will learn, that is, how do they benefit from this talk. \r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- \"Semantics rather *than* the Mechanics\"\r\n\r\n- \"protect*s* us from YAGNI\"\r\n\r\n- \"and thus facilitate*s* Emergent Design\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T18:46:28.230Z"},{"id":3972,"submission_id":6550,"talk_id":12555,"user":{"name":"Shai Yallin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e68285df5c6b2561d0453845b7b2b5ac?s=500","email":"shai.yallin@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Paulo,\r\nRe: 1 - I mean that companies start offering their products as SaaS rather than on-premise.

Masinter, Intel Corporation \r\nNathan R. Peterson, Intel Corporation\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe Advanced Deterministic Random Number Generator (ADRNG) was developed at Intel Security for use with the many security products based upon the McAfee Linux OS platform. The ADRNG provides the NIST approved SP800-90A PRNG from the native Linux kernel API. It is continuously reseeded using high quality entropy bit data form the native Linux kernel Jitter entropy driver. This ADRNG is added to the Linux 4.4 kernel, and replaces the standard drivers for both /dev/random and /dev/urandom. The result is high quality random data delivered in high volume without call blocking.\r\n\r\nProblem/Opportunity\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe ability to provide a high volume of quality random data is of interest to modern Linux server systems where a great deal of encryption requires a great deal of random data. A lack of large quantities of random data may cause encryption to run slowly. A lack of quality in the random data may cause encryption to be weak. \r\n\r\nThe particular path that led us to develop this solution was increasing scrutiny of the NIST FIPS validation standards which are diving deeper into entropy quality. The ADRNG is based upon all the learning from a year long series of FIPS lab testing while validating McAfee Linux OS. \r\nQuality random data is in demande by all modern Linux servers, with or without FIPS requirements. By developing a standards based solution that plugs into the Linux kernel, we can easily share this solution with all groups at Intel, as well as making a significant contribution to the Linux kernel upstream.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe initial implementation of this idea was for the Linux 3.18 kernel. That kernel did not contain the native API for the SP800-90A PRNG nor the Jitter entropy driver. We back ported the Jitter enropy code from a later kernel, and adapted the SP800-90A routines from the Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) open source crypto library. This worked very well, but we were concerned about the large delta of kernel code required for this method.\r\n\r\nHowever since that time, we have moved to the Linux 4.4 kernel, which does contains both the SP800-90A PRNG and the Jitter entropy driver within the kernel native API. So we have updated our solution to use only the native kernel resources. This vastly reduces the size of code required, and also provides greater confidence for those that consume the solution.\r\nScope\r\n\r\nThe initial motivation to develop the ADRNG was to meet increasingly strict NIST FIPS standards. However we have enable this solution for all modes of the kernel. Thus all products based on McAfee Linux OS will benefit from the faster and higher quality random data. This results in faster and more secure encryption.\r\n\r\nMcAfee Linux OS is used by many products at Intel Security, and all of these products will implicitly inherit the advantages of the ADRNG as they each update to the lastest MLOS kernel. Increased security will benefit the reputation and sales of Intel Security products.\r\nEngineering teams working with cryptography on Linux systems, as well as Product Managers attempting to satisfy NIST FIPS standards, would all benefit from learning more about the ADRNG.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nFor measuring the results we quantify two values: Speed and Quality. \r\n\r\n### Speed Test\r\n+ Dell PE-R610 / Xeon E5540 / 2.53GHz\r\n\r\n.            64-Bytes  1K-Bytes  64K-Bytes  64Kx64-Bytes\r\n/dev/random  0m0.002s  0m0.002s  1h,36m,13s 103h,19m,46s\r\n/dev/urandom 0m0.002s  0m0.002s  0m0.008s   2m10.672s\r\nADRNG        0m0.002s  0m0.003s  0m0.036s   2m25.836s\r\n\r\nThe speed test was performed using this simple command for each algo and block size:\r\n$ time dd if=/dev/random of=/tmp/64_random.dat bs=64 count=1\r\n\r\nWe used memory based file system (/tmp/) to reduce file i/o overhead.\r\nWe can assume file i/o overhead is consistent between all tests, since all tests have the same number and size of writes.\r\n\r\n### Quality Test\r\n•\tDell PE-R610 / Xeon E5540 / 2.53GHz\r\n\r\n.             Entropy  Arithmetic-Mean     SCC\r\n/dev/random   7.999580    127.5092         -0.001245\r\n/dev/urandom  7.999960    127.4892         -0.000524\r\nADRNG         7.999962    127.5570         -0.001057\r\n\r\nEntropy bits per byte of perfect randomness = 8.000000\r\nArithmetic mean of perfect randomness = 127.5\r\nSerial Correlation Coefficient of totally uncorrelated data = 0.0\r\n\r\nThe quality test was performed using the “ent” program which applies various entropy quality tests to byte sequences. This test was run against the sum of all data produced by the speed test above, 4,260,928 bytes.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe ADRNG provides random data at the speed of /dev/urandom and with the quality of /dev/random. Thus crypto applications no longer need to choose between speed and quality, because the ADRNG provides both.\r\n\r\nLeadership\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe ADRNG will provide greater overall quality to all Intel products which incorporate it. The ISecG security products are measured in the industry by their speed and security. The ability to run encryption faster, and with higher quality, results is something that can be measured and leveredged by product marketing to maintain and extend the Intel Security market leadership.\r\n\f\r\nLessons Learned\r\nThere were so many lessons learned from the FIPS process that we could write a book on the subject. But in summary, to track and report quality, you must collect this info:\r\n\r\n+ FOR EACH: RNG, RNG-Seed, RNG-init, Entropy, Entropy-Seed, Entropy-init\r\n+ You must be able to show this info:\r\n+ Origin of algo\r\n+ Source code of algo\r\n+ Quality tests of algo\r\n+ Performance tests of algo on various hardware platforms\r\n+ Papers and Certifications of algo\r\n\r\nIt is far better to collect this info as you go through development, rather than going back at the end and attempting to compile this info.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n1.\tENT, a program which applies various entropy quality tests to byte sequences,   http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/\r\n2.\tNIST Special Publication 800-90A, Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators, Jan 2012, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf\r\n3.\tCPU Time Jitter Based Non-Physical True Random Number Generator, 2014, Stephan Müller, https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2014/ols2014-mueller.pdf\r\n","notes":"- I am the manager and co-founder of the McAfee Linux OS project at Intel Corp.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. I fully agree with Yogeshwar. You should also discuss the challenges and drawbacks of serverless architecture. Software architects need to understand the tradeoffs that come with any design decision. A lot of material we see out there about the newest and brightest idea often only emphasize the benefits. Surely serverless is not the best solution for all cases.\r\n\r\n2. The term serverless is actually quite broad and poorly defined. For example, [Mike Roberts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) associates serverless to the use of MBaaS (more common), or alternatively richer clients (SPA?) talking to services behind an API gateway. Thus, I hope your talk has a clear description of what a serverless architecture is. A brief definition of serverless in the talk description would also be helpful to correctly set the expectations of participants looking at the conference program.\r\n\r\n3. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n4. Like Michael, I too see significant overlap with your other submission.

You must make some intentional changes to keep your skills relevant:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\tPlatforms over Projects - The resurgence of modularity as a focus is being fueled by cloud computing paradigm.

The result is a focus on design of platforms and frameworks that can absorb organic change in business needs over time. </li>\r\n<li>\tPatterns and Pragmatism  - Patterns have been around for over two decades and the rise of the API economy and platform focused design is shining a spot light on identifying the right fit patterns.  Patterns are provided to the Developers and Designers freeing them to focus on building business features.   The challenge is to avoid ivory-tower syndrome  pragmatically apply patterns that will make them most impact and reduce risk. </li>\r\n<li>Master Craftsman and Apprentice - The architect has a responsibility to mentor other techs.  With the pace of change, the architect has to be open to being the apprentice as new ideas and techniques surface through the curious developers and passionate designers.</li>\r\n<li>Master Communicator  - Whether an junior architect in training in training or a well-seasoned senior arch,  the ability to communicate crisply and succinctly is an imperative whether written or spoken.</li>\r\n\r\n","notes":"I've been an architect for over 22 years and have continually reinvented and retooled myself.

I see that I was not as clear as in intended and would love to revise if you are open to that.  Here are some of the thoughts I can elaborate on.\r\n\t\r\nI agree that some of the changes I mentioned, like master communicator, have been suggested and agreed to in the past as a quality.  Our profession, however, fell victim to over-granularity and many of these qualities were seen as \"nice to have\" and not a show stopper if they were missing.  \r\n\t\r\nThe dramatic changes in our profession make these qualities no longer are suggestions but imperatives.    The trait I mentioned are cornerstone though alone, will not be enough. \r\n\t\r\nOver the years, we've seen a proliferation of specializations for architects: middleware or integration architect, RDBMS architect, infrastructure architect, UI architect, enterprise,  and so on.  There is a gravitational pull driven by cloud and DevOps that is democratizing architectural activities and pushing the need for architects to wear many hats.  For example, the application architect understand integration and infrastructure architecture as well as operations.  An architect of any type must intentionally become more widely skilled.  We must strive to be   polymaths passionately commanding the full architectural continuum and more!   There will always be the need for a few edge architects who keep wholly focused on a single discipline though the vast majority must intentionally change their aperture. \r\n\t\r\nTo keep the example simple, consider an organization adopting DevOps principles.  For the intentional architect, this means having a full command of their ecosystem from software defined infrastructure, to pipeline engineering and deployment automation, to operational monitoring and the resulting analytics.  \r\n\t\r\nThe intentional architect needs to be a passionate learner beyond technology to understand impacting business and law.  Why?  Consider cloud:  intentional architects have to understand security, policy and possibly international law, scalability, SLAs, and be able to suggest and drive right-sized governance.  The intentional architect also has to be a historian and able to analyze contributions to technical debt as organizations look to refactor, redesign, in addition to building new.  \r\n\t\r\nIt is somewhat daunting for experienced architects to change the aperture and cultivate a polymath mindset that actively focuses on using their myriad skills to keep drive simplicity and embrace pragmatism.   The commitment to being an intentional architect will be key for success as we enter this next epoch.","created_at":"2017-01-30T03:03:15.196Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T03:03:15.196Z"}]}},{"id":7973,"submission":{"id":7973,"state":"rejected","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-12T22:53:54.608Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T20:03:43.796Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQd49Y_7Lh0","rating":25.5,"trust":40.0,"tag_list":["development","communication","iteration","ideation","sketching","design"],"profile":{"name":"Rizwan Javaid","bio":"Rizwan is a User Experience Designer.

I'm a bit torn regarding your proposal.  On the one hand I agree that sketching is a useful and powerful tool.  I also enjoy sketching exercises and have seen the many positive benefits of becoming a confident sketcher - including my own 30 day sketch challenge.  On the other hand, at least with software architecture design, we are often concerned with models and reasoning.  I worry that your proposal overemphasizes sketching without a clear connection to modelling and using the sketches to reason about important system properties.\r\n\r\nPros I see in this talk\r\n\r\n* Looks like a really interactive hands on session\r\n* Presenter is passionate about the topic\r\n* Sketching is a useful skill and something many developers could use more practice with.\r\n\r\nCons I see in this talk\r\n\r\n* No clear connection to software architecture\r\n* Risks further perpetuating boxology and \"architecture is just boxes and lines\" mentality with no connection to modelling or otherwise using diagrams to reason about system properties\r\n\r\nRizwan, What is your vision for where the sketching techniques you'll practice during the session will fit in a developer's tool box?

Since I don't have a full grasp of the software architecture domain I would start off by getting architects to understand the power of sketching, which is using sketching for ideation, iteration, and communication of ideas.

We want them to evolve with the needs of the business, its customers and stakeholders, and to be resilient in the face of ever changing market conditions and the external environment. This level of adaptability and responsiveness needs to be supported by the architecture of the systems we create. The complexity of the environment that architects find themselves in is increasing in recent years, with cloud, DevOps, continuous deployment, micro services and other elements adding to the factors that architects must consider. With this growing complexity, architects need to be supported by effective decision-making approaches.\r\n\r\nSize is also a factor. Larger systems and larger organizations have, by definition, a larger number of dependencies (internal and external) that must be managed, and a larger number of stakeholders (internal and external) whose needs must be addressed. The architecture of larger systems can involve hundreds or thousands of people, creating dozens to hundreds of products, components and subsystems that all need to work together. Maintaining the conceptual integrity of the architecture under such circumstances, and over time, presents many challenges and a greater need for coherence. \r\n\r\nTo navigate all of this, agile architects need to be adaptive; they need the ability to dynamically shift their decision-making approach to match the complexity of the circumstances they face. This session will describe how lessons from complexity science, and in particular, sense making and the Cynefin framework, can help architects to be more agile in how they work, and in turn, help them develop architectures that are more agile and adaptive to the needs of the organizations they serve.\r\n\r\n### Learning Outcomes\r\n* Applying sense making in the context of architecture\r\n* Applying the Cynefin framework to architecture problems and decisions\r\n* Examples of architecture problems and decisions that can be mapped to the different domains represented by the Cynefin framework (obvious, complicated, complex, chaotic and disorder)\r\n* How to manage the transition of architecture problems between these different domains\r\n* Implications for organization structure and communications\r\n* How such an approach leads to a more resilient architecture, and a more antifragile organization\r\n* How complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework supports emergent architecture\r\n* How complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework help the organization and the architecture to be more agile\r\n\r\n### Format\r\nFor a 90-minute workshop I typically use the following format. \r\n\r\nPart 1 (5 minutes):\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n* Overview of concepts\r\n\r\nPart 2 (10 minutes): \r\n\r\n* Architecture descriptions\r\n* Using narrative to understand architecture\r\n\r\nPart 3 (40 minutes):\r\n\r\n* Sense Making analysis of architectures and their influence on the organisation\r\n* Analysing the patterns that emerge from the sense making activity\r\n\r\nPart 4 (30 minutes):\r\n\r\n* The Cynefin Framework, and how it applies to architecture\r\n* Designing experiments\r\n\r\nPart 5 (5 minutes):\r\n\r\n* Debrief and wrap up\r\n\r\n","notes":"The majority of the session is highly participatory. All five parts outlined in the session description have some element of participation. Parts 2-4 are the major parts of the session. In part 2, I guide participants through sketching their architecture and creating narrative about their architecture. In part 3, I guide participants in analysing their architecture/sketch/narrative using a sense making framework. In part 4, I guide participants in understanding the Cynefin framework in more detail and designing an experiment to address complex challenges that emerge in the analysis. Parts 1 and 5 have less activity, but still have dialog and interaction.\r\n\r\nI will bring all the supplies that I need to run the exercise. It is more effective if the room is set up “banquet style”, with round tables that set groups of 6-10. \r\n\r\nI have been working with sensemaking and complexity for a few years now, and have run variations of this activity many times, both inside Cisco and at conferences and other forums. At the heart of this is the concept of applying sensemaking and the Cynefin framework to managing the complexity faced by architects. That complexity is not just in the architecture itself, but also in the problem domain, the organization, and the wider context within which architects do their work.\r\n\r\nMy background is in software engineering and architecture, in the context of product and systems development, and in transforming engineering organizations around the world. I use the techniques I present here in my own work, and I also help architects, engineers, and others, apply these techniques in their work.\r\n","abstract":"To create resilient and antifragile systems, architects must use decision-making approaches that help them better navigate the complexity of their environment.

In my experience this happens for a few reasons:  architecture documentation is rejected as being too heavyweight, documentation is typically out of sight and out of mind, and many developers don't know what to document.  Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), a lightweight documentation approach [proposed by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), solves these problems by recording design decisions in a simple markdown template in the same repository as the code affected by the ADR.  In this talk we will share our experiences and lessons using ADRs over the past year while working on multiple projects for IBM Watson.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk you will be able to create effective ADRs, introduce them to your team, and avoid common pitfalls with the method.","notes":"This talk is intended to be a 30 minute experience report.  I can't figure out how to change the session type to match this.\r\n\r\nThe talk will have the following tentative outline.\r\n\r\n1. Introduction / Problem overview: teammates don't have architectural context, decisions aren't communicated and are lost over time\r\n   * Failed attempts to solve the problem -- wikis, dedicated repos, \"official\" documentation\r\n2. ADRs Overview\r\n   * Nygard's proposal\r\n   * Connection to other work and research\r\n3. How we use ADRs\r\n4. Exercise: Create an ADR (optional, may fall out depending on timing, at most this is a 5-7 minute exercise)\r\n5. Case Study: IBM Watson Information Retrieval Enhanced team\r\n   * This section will include the proposed lessons and tips for adopting and using ADRs based on our experiences\r\n   * Create a common template that everyone agrees to use\r\n       * examples from case study\r\n   * Identify an architecture champion to point out when architectural design decisions happen\r\n   * Add ADR creation tasks to the backlog\r\n   * Use pull requests and peer reviews to teach people how to record a decision and to\r\n       spread konwledge about decisions\r\n   * Use ADRs to grow architects on your team\r\n       * Creating an ADR is a small slice of design responsibility.  It turns out to be a great way to\r\n           infuse the team with architectural thinking and train new architects\r\n   * Store ADRs with the code\r\n   * Works great with microservices where small groups of people and the code\r\n       they create work autonomously within a light governance framework\r\n   * Revisit old ADRs every so often to update them and ensure you have accurate reflection of current thinking\r\n6. Problems we ran into with ADRs and are still working through\r\n   * Plain text diagramming is a pain point.\r\n   * ADRs emphasize architectural decisions for a single component.  This is great for smaller projects and\r\n      individual microservices but falls apart when multiple architectural components stored in multiple code\r\n      repositories are involved.\r\n      * Our solution was to create an \"Architecture\" repository, which stored ADRs that cut across multiple\r\n         architectural components, linking to refinement ADRs as appropriate.\r\n   * Overemphasis on design decisions at the expense of other design documentation\r\n       * The team became awesome at recording ADRs to the point where they wouldn't document anything else!\r\n       * ADRs were smashing success.  Complementary methods that are as simple and lightweight are needed for\r\n          design concepts other than decisions.  examples: alternatives, governance policies, general design guidance,\r\n          quality attribute scenarios and other architecturally significant requirements\r\n7. Conclusion\r\n   * closing thoughts on using ADRs as a way to \"sneak in\" architecture\r\n   * great way to create a history of the project and explain not only where we are but how the system arrived at this point\r\n   * Show where ADRs fit as part of an documentation strategy \r\n   * Links to additional resources","abstract":"Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture key architectural design decisions in a lightweight, easy-to-create, plain text template stored in your existing version control system.

I am familiar with the Tyree/Ackermann paper.  I actually [referenced the same paper as a comment on the blog](http://disq.us/p/18d4i4r) about 8 months ago in an attempt to point out the same thing!  We also include a link to Nygard's blog and that paper in our ADR template as background information.\r\n\r\nI am certainly planning to make this connection in the talk, if accepted.  The two templates have the same goal in the end but collect slightly different information.  The ADR is significantly simpler, if nothing else.  I think a key difference and the thing that is kind of unique about Nygard's approach is in what is done with this information.  It sounds simple, but storing the design decisions in the version control system acted almost as a stealth way of injecting some of the ideas from Views and Beyond into the team.  What's more a small ecosystem of tools has sprung up around ADRs.  See https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools and https://github.com/holytshirt/dotnet-adr as examples.\r\n\r\nFinally, Thougtworks recently [classified ADRs as \"trial\" methodology](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records).

I first encountered the importance of maintaining Architectural Decisions ass a part of the SEI Views and Beyond book. I have been a great advocate and have used them ever since. I think its an important technique that needs good attention and would help many Architects attending the conference. The approach of understanding software architecture in terms of a variety of architecture decisions is now widely recognized.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do have a suggestion. Instead of the talk just focusing on ADR as suggested by Michael Nygard, what would be even useful is discussing the approaching of Documenting Architecture Decisions as a whole, which decisions to document and not, the payback/benefits and the variants available for documenting them along with your case study.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am concerned about the idea of just storing the Architecture Decisions in isolation without many other significant Architectural Artifacts. I understand that the Thoughtworks seems to recommend including them in the “trial” methodology. However, I am just concerned with the misnomer that these are the only set of significant artifacts for all cases. Could the details be presented more on the lines of Evolutionary Architecture.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-04T06:17:59.216Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T06:17:59.216Z"},{"id":3066,"submission_id":7391,"talk_id":14103,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Yogeshwar, thanks for your feedback!\r\n\r\nI share your concerns and plan to address them in the talk.  I mentioned the points you raise under section 6.  I am certainly not suggesting this is the only set of artifacts required and recognize this is a trap teams easily fall into -- one of my teams did!\r\n\r\nWith respect to deciding when to document a decision vs. not, I plan to cover that under 5.4 and 5.5.  It turns out that people don't always know or recognize when an architectural decision has been made.  Pull requests and explicit architecture tasks combined with pairing was how we worked through some of those issues, in addition to including clear guidance in our template.  Basically we created situations for on the job training over time.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to attempt to place this technique within the context of the broader literature, as you suggest.  As you also point out, the idea of recording decisions is not new and is a commonly understood good practice.  The point of this talk is not to retread old ground but to look at good practice from the perspective of a newer method that people actually use and seems to resonate well with developers.  These ideas have been around for a while, and yet few teams practice them.  Why?  I think this method is another incremental step in the right direction.  By the end of the talk people will be armed with the knowledge they need to be successful with the method, not just try it out.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMichael","created_at":"2017-01-04T14:17:27.098Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T14:17:27.098Z"},{"id":3075,"submission_id":7391,"talk_id":14103,"user":{"name":"Yogeshwar Srikrishnan","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33bed537dc2a17123b3491737913e0a9?s=500","email":"yoga80@yahoo.com"},"body":"Thanks for the detail!

The updates do help to answer my questions, but it does leave me with a couple of concerns.\r\n\r\nThe first is still regarding the the claim: \"Deploy any application to any environment using any tool-set – for free.\" \r\n\r\nWhen you say \"free\" do you mean free of licensing cost, or free of the cost of \"the operational and technology overhead.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim that it is free of licencing cost is valid, with a few caveats.  The tools being integrated are free of charge and Electric Cloud can be free for up to 10 community hosts.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not so sure about the claim regarding overhead costs.  As you say earlier in the submission: \"the operational and technology overhead of orchestrating the hand-offs from one tool to the next in the process are not without cost.\"  The later claim that you\r\n\r\nDoes electric cloud eliminate costs for ANY tool, or only the tools for which a plug-in already exists?   What about tools that do not have an existing plug-in?  \r\n\r\nMy second concern is that the presentation feels like product demonstration.  It appears to introduce the problem of overhead costs for automation and orchestration and then present Electric Cloud as the solution to that problem.\r\n\r\nThe audience of Architects would like to go deeper than that.  They would be interested in seeing how Electric Cloud is solving this problem.

This covers areas such as integration (how do I get data into / out of the blockchain), analytics (how do I gain insight into the data held by the blockchain?), and APIs (providing managed access to a blockchain within an enterprise).\r\n- Recommendations on how to get started\r\n\r\nI also weave a couple of demonstrations into the flow, just to show what a blockchain \"looks like\" (e.g. what does a smart contract look like, how does an integration technology tie into a blockchain).  The session is geared towards \"beginners\", so this particular talk does not get into the \"low-level\" details of the code.\r\n\r\nThis talk can also fit into a 30 minute session if that would work better for the agenda.

I agree this is an important topic for organizations that want to move to continuous deployment, especially when their systems use shared databases. Database changes are not handled directly by Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. You need something else tool-wise. \r\nIn our organization we are using Flyway. One of the challenges we are facing is that the DBAs lose operational control over table schemas. That's less of a problem if each system (or microservice) has its own dedicated database. But in many enterprise IT environments, there's still some centralization of database changes. Continuous delivery/deployment with Flyway (or similar) will typically ask developers to author DDL statements that will eventually be automatically executed in production upon system initialization. I hope your presentation will touch on this aspect.","created_at":"2017-02-07T12:19:33.147Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T12:19:33.147Z"}]}},{"id":7834,"submission":{"id":7834,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-10T14:52:26.339Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:07:54.622Z","additional_info":"Links for Presentations\r\n\r\nAWS Reinvent 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbLhfiXVP6Q&index=2&list=PLz79c1Qow_bW8DdjJKRtIRngqKEArQ4Rm\r\n\r\nServerless Conf London Oct 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-w6a9rcy8&index=1&list=PLz79c1Qow_bW8DdjJKRtIRngqKEArQ4Rm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlog by authors\r\n\r\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/microservice-delivery-with-amazon-ecs-and-application-load-balancers/\r\nhttps://developer.capitalone.com/blog-post/delivering-microservices-for-enterprise-with-devops/\r\n\r\n","rating":100.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["cloud resiliency serverless","30-min tech talk"],"profile":{"name":"Sathiya Shunmugasundaram","bio":"Sathiya has been working in IT for the last 20 years.

Please find more information you have asked for below.\r\n\r\nWhat is your definition of chaos engineering?\r\n\r\nIn our definition, Chaos Engineering is a discipline where we will simulate real world failures which occur rarely and cause catastrophic losses to the systems. This is much more important in cloud environments where we have completely relinquished the infrastructure management and high level service management to the cloud provider. Traditional testing mechanisms do not cover such self inflicted failures. Using Chaos Engineering tools, applications can subject themselves to failures and measure their resiliency.\r\n\r\nHow do you commonly work with teams to improve their microservices?\r\n\r\nAs part of integration and performance testing of applications, we engage them and set them up with cloud detour, the chaos engineering tool. The application teams can then start registering various failures against the application and infrastructure. For example random termination of servers and high CPU simulation affecting the processes. This will help evaluate how the microservice performed against the failures and if it still met the NFRs.\r\n\r\nhow generally applicable the solution you use at Capital One is or whether it is highly specific to your needs\r\n\r\nThe solution is very generic for applications deployed in AWS. Any AWS deployed application will be able to use the various aspects of solution whether the application just uses Infrastructure services like EC2 or higher level application services like ECS/S3\r\n\r\nAdditional information on AWS and general availability\r\n\r\nThe tool received a great feedback in its initial pilot and currently being aggressively adopted by various divisions. Over next few months, we will be able to make it Open Source ready for the community use. Also one of our objectives is to build an abstraction layer over the capabilities and make it available in other cloud providers like Azure and Google cloud. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSathiya \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-22T03:04:34.247Z","updated_at":"2017-01-22T03:04:34.247Z"},{"id":4264,"submission_id":7834,"talk_id":14873,"user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Sathiya,\r\nThanks for your submission. I have a couple of suggestions: \r\n\r\n1. Your talk description does not mention automation anywhere. A conference participant who's not familiar with Chaos Monkey or \"chaos engineering\" may wonder if the approach being described is fully automated (on one end) or is about a strategy to \"manually\" engineer scenarios to test resiliency. Since today we pursue the \"automation of all things\", I think the description should say to what degree the solution uses automation and integrates to CI.\r\n\r\n2. You mention mission critical applications, but don't qualify the applications any further. You could be more specific in the description.

I have updated the abstract addressing your comments as below, please review.\r\n\r\nCloud is ubiquitous, but failures are unavoidable and unpredictable raising uncertainty and are risk to the systems. Traditional approaches can’t predict all failure modes because of changing data conditions, complex request patterns, ever increasing innovation and growing scale. Chaos engineering is a discipline to simulate these failures. In our cloud-detour solution, we describe how mission critical applications like high volume customer facing web applications or critical batch applications using compute/storage/networking services in the cloud can register themselves in an automated way to test against several failure scenarios and demonstrate their resiliency level.  This can help application engineers assess and provide adequate resiliency and solid disaster recovery strategy. Cloud Detour itself is management free with Serverless implementation and can be integrated with application CICD pipelines and provides approval workflows with application owners, application health checking before and after disruptions and alerting.

We treat connectors as self-contained, physical (i.e. binary), identifiable special-purpose components that isolate interfaces from communicating components. We intentionally place interfaces contained in connectors in the forefront of any kind of component system. \r\n\r\nThrough interfaces in connectors, components can be supplied with extra-functional services, such as the monitoring and budgeting of system-resource usage, the profiling of architecturally relevant components, and the checking of communication protocols. These services are beneficial for industrial systems that are maintained and evolve in the field. Connectors are a means of realizing blue/green deployments, canary releases, and performance monitors; all of which are necessary for DevOps scenarios that work in industrial environments. Connectors take over these tasks. Components can focus on their core businesses.\r\n\r\nEven without any extra-functional services, connectors provide two significant advantages to the development and operation of resource-constrained, safety-critical embedded systems. Firstly, connectors physically decouple communicating components, in the sense that components depend on (reference) connectors but connectors do not depend on components. Secondly, for implementation connectors do not need heavyweight component frameworks or middleware as usually in distributed systems.\r\n\r\nConnectors can be built for and operated in rich runtime environments such as .NET CLR, and in thin runtime environments such as crt0 for C++ programs. Basically, for our purposes, build and runtime environments need only to support interfaces in the sense of the identically named language concept and linkable compilation units. To build connectors of different kinds, we use several techniques and design patterns of different pattern languages in various combinations, for example Factory, Strategy and Decorator from E. Gamma et al., Registry from M. Fowler, Bounded Context from E. Evans and Insulation from J. Lakos.\r\n\r\nThe presentation is divided into four parts. In the first part we introduce the minimal connector and explain the consequences and benefits for developing, testing and configuring component systems. In the second part we develop the minimal connector into light connectors containing plain interfaces (call and callback) and then into heavy connectors with additional extra-functional services. In the third part we apply connectors for structuring a system whose development follows the DevOps methodology. In the fourth and final part, with a better understanding of our motivation, objectives, nature, assemblage and application of connectors in our practice, we work out similarities and differences in comparison with the Interceptor pattern from D. Schmidt et al. and component-and-connector views (SEI: Documenting Software Architectures, 2nd ed.).","notes":"","abstract":"Physically independent connectors decouple components without performance costs.

I have a few comments on specific assertions you make in the talk description. \r\n\r\n1. \"We view software architectures as systems of connectors.\"  Well, architecture is more than that. The literature on software architecture today is clear to say that software architecture encompasses multiple *views* (or perspectives, viewpoints). An architecture view that shows the components (runtime elements) and connectors is one of them. But a view that describes, for example, how the source code is organized in layers, or packages, namespaces is also part of the software architecture. A view that shows how different components are allocated to different hardware elements or nodes is also part of the software architecture. A view that shows the data entities and their relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many) in a data centric information system is also part of the software architecture. So, I think this statement should be more flexible to say something like \"An important perspective of any software architecture is the one that shows a system of connectors.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"A connector is a self-contained, physical (i.e. binary), identifiable special-purpose component that isolates interfaces from communicating components.\"  There are overloaded definitions of components and connectors out there. I particularly like the ones in \"Documenting Software Architectures, Second Edition\". This book says a \"Components are the principal computational elements and data stores that execute in a system.\"  Then it says \"A connector is a runtime pathway of interaction between two or more components.\"  The book makes clear that connectors are first-class citizens in the software architecture. But your definition seems too strict. For example, when a Javascript web page (the client component) makes an http call to a REST service (the server component), I see the http communication as the connector. However, in my architecture I don't have a physical, binary, identifiable element for that connector.  I also find it confusing to say that a connector is a (type of) component. Conceptually, it's easier to separate components from connectors.\r\n\r\n3. \"Connectors are a means of realizing blue/green deployments, canary releases, and performance monitors\". Often times, performance monitoring, logging, and other similar functionalities are performed by interceptors. An interceptor is not a connector, it's a special type of component. It's special because it is not called directly, it does not have a visible interface; instead, the interceptor will \"listen\" to the communication and will intercept messages/calls/events of interest. In the example I mentioned (JS component talking to a REST service), an interceptor could intercept the http calls for monitoring, logging, routing, message transformation, security controls. \r\n\r\n4. \"Firstly, connectors physically decouple communicating components, in the sense that components depend on connectors but connectors do not depend on components.\"  The level of coupling actually varies based on the type of connector. For example, an EJB client component will use the EJB-specific RPC connector to call the EJB component. That EJB client is tightly coupled to the EJB. OTOH, if a Java component sends a message to a JMS queue and there is another Java component that consumes messages from that queue, these two components are indeed decoupled because of the presence of the message queue connector. \r\n\r\n5. \"In the third part we apply connectors for structuring a system whose development follows the DevOps methodology.\"  I'm thinking much of what you call connectors is actually about interceptors. A DevOps strategy asks for health and performance monitoring that is visible to Devs as well as Ops. Much of that functionality is achieved by interceptors often provided by tools such as API gateways, zabbix, etc. \r\n\r\nI'm being picky wrt the use of core architecture concepts, but your talk seems pretty sound and valuable. \r\n","created_at":"2017-02-07T12:53:05.916Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T12:53:05.916Z"},{"id":4392,"submission_id":8138,"talk_id":15470,"user":{"name":"Joachim Fröhlich, Florian Krautwurm, Markus Lachenmayr","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f17b85f0f3df832a3bfbce052a9e3ce8?s=500","email":"florian.krautwurm@gmail.com"},"body":"Dear Paulo,\r\n\r\nthank you for your valuable feedback.\r\n\r\nWhile not able to address all your points, we have improved the talk description, in particular regarding connectors and the interceptor pattern.\r\n\r\nWe focus indeed on physical connectors, first-class citizens in the software architecture. Reduced to the minimum, a connector in our practice only contains one or more related interfaces (types) without implementations, and a somewhat special factory.\r\nAs the name suggests, interfaces are between components. Interfaces do not belong to the components communicating through interfaces, locally or remotely, sequentially or in parallel. In fact, we argue that interfaces rather than components carry component-based systems of any kind -- not just of distributed systems or of systems that rely on generalized middleware (component frameworks) containing or enabling interceptors. These thoughts should point out particular properties and advantages of \"our\" connectors and some differences to interceptors and to Aspect-Oriented Programming as well. \r\n\r\nWe will compare and contrast related work, views, and approaches in the new fourth part of the presentation.

In this talk I discuss integrity on several levels: \r\n\r\nFirst, not all of the alternatives I present are actually a departure from persons or small groups driving the architecture. \"Marshalls\" are typically accountable for a cross-cutting concern spanning the whole system or big parts of it. They look after integrity in architectural approaches assotiated with security, performance or recurring technical problems with infrastructure etc. So the classic architect is splitted, but not in a functional fashion as the system itsself.\r\nAlso the approach of an architecture owner encapsulates important topics in one person. In this case it is a person with general overview, experience and a broad vision. He is more of a mentor and rises important topics. He isn't the one who decides and designs everything though. This is mapped to a team where he has the same possibilities and tools as everyone else. Conceptual Integrity is an important driver for him though. \r\nOnly one of the presented options goes without a person or team explicitly and foremost responsible for the architecture. \r\n\r\nSecond, the integrity of a system has big advantages in productivity, maintainability and derivatively in reliability, security and so on. Nevertheless it comes at a cost and many modern systems see conceptual integrity as a scale, where the maximum is not the ultimate goal. We could for instance define a minimum of common ground that works for a given project. Could be the deployment model, the general structure, the monitoring and security approaches and some interface standards. Inside these general rules a team could in fact develop solutions that are structured very differently and possibly use other technologies than other teams of the same project. Of course this poses problems in reusability and the other areas stated, on the other hand the teams can act on their own and usually deliver value faster. If the architectural drivers and the context allow it, a little less integrity could be optimal for a project.\r\n\r\nThird, even without an architect that predefines approaches and tactics we were able to achieve a good level of architectural integrity. Integrity is driven by a good engineering process, broad architectural knowledge, experimenting developers and some kind of \"natural selection process\". This selection process includes that good solutions are broadcasted to all teams and their adaptation is made easier. Bad ideas or the divergence from a known best practice should be harder to implement. In the acstract I call that \"low viscosity design\". Architecture then focuses on the identification of good approaches, the support of their communication and the creation of space to abstract good solutions and make them more universal. This is another form of architectural work as the \"standards-first\" approach, with arguably lower conceptual integrity, but often faster innovation, better flexibility and more realistic architectural concepts. A combination of top-down and bottom-up architectural approaches is a good fit for most projects I work on, low viscosity can shift the boundary a little in the bottom-up direction without causing direct chaos.\r\n\r\nAll of these topics are introduced in this talk, not all of them are covered in great detail. I am open to shifting the focus of the talk a bit if certain aspects sound very interesting for you. The 90min version will have a deeper look and also an exercise on some veto-mechanisms we use to broaden the accountability but not lessen the influence of good architects.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nStefan","created_at":"2017-01-31T15:20:11.449Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T15:20:11.449Z"},{"id":4436,"submission_id":8183,"talk_id":15549,"user":{"name":"Stefan Toth","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/09f421cbcb8ddf7506526e1096672630?s=500","email":"stefan.toth@embarc.de"},"body":"Thank you for accepting my talk for SATURN 2017!

While there is some work in this field, most of it has been devoted to metrics and estimates. Metrics are shadows of snowflakes, and thus not particularly informative when seeking to understand the purpose of a system or the behavior of a component. Improving estimation, while an interesting application and a laudable goal, likewise does not directly help developers create better software faster, nor manage the growing complexity of real-world systems. Can we apply ML in ways that help guide development, inform software archaeology, and reduce effort for developers? If so, can these things help us take on the systems-of-systems-of-systems of the future, where million-line code bases will be considered \"quaint\"?\r\nAfter a brief survey of existing/past work in the area, we'll investigate the question of \"what does software look like\", examine the more interesting question of \"what does good software look like\", and use these insights to explore how we can enable developers to create and manage ever-larger software systems. No ML experience or math required. Lots of pretty pictures.\r\n","notes":"I've been research the applications of AI/ML/DL to software development, and experimenting with some unique approaches specifically intended to aid software developers, including the notion of 'semantic drift' (the 'distance' between classes and stories in semantic space) and topic-based clustering of software subsystems as a guide to refactoring.

How many devs, how many ops, number of applications/microservices involved, size of the infrastructure. \r\n\r\n2. SATURN has a diverse international crowd. Please consider using more generic terms instead of PHI and PII. Likewise, you may add a short sentence that clarifies how big is UPMC. Many attendees will not know it's one of the largest health care organizations in the US. \r\n\r\n3. In the Notes, you say \"in this initiative we leveraged packages provided by several vendors (Amazon, Microsoft, Dell, and others) and open source software such as GitHub, Artifactory, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes.\" I think you should move that sentence to the Description, which will be visible to conference participants, and will catch their attention. \r\n\r\n4. I hope you will talk about lessons learned, things that worked and things that didn't work. \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6.

REST over HTTP is a popular choice for microservices APIs because it promotes openness, self-discovery, and simplicity.  One alternative to REST is [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/), an implementation of Protobuf.  As an RPC-based API, gRPC inhibits openness and self-discovery but promotes performance and, depending on the implementation, can provide stronger compile-time (or at least call-time) guarantees which help developers avoid mistakes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will share our experiences migrating a REST-based microservice to gRPC, as well as lessons learned implementing gRPC APIs in a suite of backing microservices for the Watson Discovery Service.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, attendees will know\r\n\r\n* What gRPC is and how it is different from REST\r\n* How to organize code to make API transitions easier\r\n* The benefits of functional testing using Cucumber and tips for creating extensible gRPC API tests using Ruby\r\n* How to implement common REST patterns in gRPC\r\n* Common pitfalls for using gRPC in a microservices architecture and some solutions","notes":"This talk will have the following tentative outline.\r\n\r\n1.

A disavantage of typical RPC solutions that has bothered us is the need to distribute stubs to client applications. \r\nIt negatively affects deployability. I hope you'll comment on that in your presentation. \r\nYears ago in our organization, a feature that motivated the use of RPC (EJB in our case) is the ability to run distributed transactions (ACID-like with 2PC).

Our architecture pattern languages have changed as have our development, deployment, and operating procedures (DevOps).  \r\n\r\nDuring this transition, one source of ideas has been the functional programming community.  Functional programming itself mostly happens within a module and indeed many software architects treat it as an implementation choice, unrelated to architecture.  But it turns out that some ideas from the FP community are helpful in architectural design: statelessness, immutability, and pure functions.  They underlie DevOps practices and are at the core of many distributed systems patterns at the core of our architectures.\r\n\r\n## Why now?  \r\nFunctional programming ideas have been around for a long time but conditions are ripe.\r\n\r\n1.  Coping strategy for complexity.  As systems get bigger but our brains stay the same size, we invent tech to cope.  Statelessness, immutability, and pure functions make it easier to reason about how a system behaves.\r\n2.  Problems grew in size.  No single computer big enough to run a system.  FP ideas suited to parallelism and concurrency, so many smaller computers can solve big problems.\r\n3.  We have more money than sense.  You can buy 100 cloud machines for less than one junior developer.  So why not do Continuous Integration with every source code commit?  Why not have a farm of servers running different versions of your code during deployments?  Why not burn RAM with immutable data structures?\r\n\r\n## Functional ideas in modern architectures\r\n\r\n1. Client-side.  Reactive patterns and frameworks.  Eg React, CycleJS, Elm.\r\n2. Server-side.  So-called \"serverless\" pure functions.  REST architectural style.  Reactive services.  Event queues between services.\r\n3. Persistence.  Append-only datastores.  Event sourcing & Command Query Response Segregation (CQRS).\r\n4. Batch sequential & pipeline architectures:  Big data processing (Hadoop, Spark), Map-Reduce, Tensorflow and other machine learning graph-based functional transformation.\r\n5. Devops infrastructure.  Version control everything (append-only).  So-called \"immutable\" and \"idempotent\" infrastructure set up by running code, not by Linux admins.\r\n\r\n## Reactive programming\r\n1. What is it?  Evolution of Observer pattern.  Observable = Observer pattern plus onError and onCompletion.  Hot and cold streams.\r\n2. Use in UI architectures.  Strong competitor to Model-View-Controller and sibling patterns.  \r\n\r\n## What you will learn in this talk\r\nThe amount of innovation and hype in web technologies is intense and often overwhelming.  If you haven't been staying current, this talk should give you a mental map to start your learning.  If you have stayed current, this talk should reveal how functional ideas weave throughout modern web architectures and perhaps provide insight into why they work.\r\n\r\nThe talk surveys how modern web systems are built with FP patterns.  It will dig into one client-side example and show how FP ideas can simplify this task.","notes":"I propose this as a 30-minute tech talk.  I can scale the material to fit into 22 mins + questions.\r\n\r\nI have plenty of material so I'm happy to do a 90-minute tech talk that digs into more details if you think the topic is sufficiently interesting.  90-minute slots are rare at SATURN, so I don't want to presume.  \r\n\r\nIf you think 90 minutes is better than 30, please consider this as a participatory session.  If the audience is really new to FP ideas, it can take time to see how to accomplish work using these patterns.  There is a great game we could play a few rounds of ([Cube Composer](http://david-peter.de/cube-composer)) to warm them up (go ahead and try it now).  Then we could design a system using event queues and discuss the quality attribute tradeoffs, or go further into the UI reactive example.","abstract":"Functional programming (FP) has invaded architectures.

Leveraging this and other AWS services, it has become possible to build entire business applications in a secure, scalable fashion, without provisioning VMs or taking on the system administration tasks that entails. There has since been quite a bit of buzz around 'Serverless' development, with entire frameworks and tooling built to support such an approach. This talk is intended to discuss what the tradeoffs of taking such an approach are, how to technically execute on such an approach within AWS, and what my own experiences have been in building and running Serverless applications in production.","notes":"90 minutes\r\n\r\nAs the backend tech lead at Stanley Black and Decker I have led the development and deployment of multiple applications into production that rely entirely on Serverless backends, along with a hybrid legacy app that we are currently moving toward being Serverless. \r\n\r\nI intend to cover the basics of building REST interfaces on top of the AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda, delve into the tradeoffs of doing so, and then branch out into methods and considerations of data storage, access control (including authorization/authentication of users to your REST endpoints and other resources), continuous integration and development, messaging patterns (both solely on the backend, and between the backend and various user clients), backend generated events and triggers (i.e., responding to scheduled events, or building in logic to trigger additional behaviors outside of the context of a user request), and various best practices and considerations I've learned from my experiences.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this talk I will touch on the place of the following AWS services in a Serverless solution - Lambda, API Gateway, S3, Dynamo, RDS, Elasticache, IAM, Cognito, STS, SQS, SNS, IoT, CloudFormations, Cloudfront, Route 53.\r\n\r\nThe intended presentation mechanism is predominantly slides, with links to code and Cloudformations to illustrate less obvious implementation strategies  (i.e., not \"here's how to write a record to DynamoDB\", which is easily gleaned from API documents, but \"here's code demonstrating the usage of the AWS IoT platform as a websocket for sending arbitrary messages across\", or \"here's an example Cloudformation for setting up an existing lambda to execute periodically, and to include a dead letter queue to report errors to\". In general, my goal is not to give an end to end working example of everything I discuss (as that will be impossible to go over in detail in the time frame, and will be exceptionally contrived), but instead to go over enough to give people a high degree of confidence in speccing out their own projects, while also providing code or walk through an example for anything that did not strike me as inherently obvious on how to implement from glancing at AWS' documentation. \r\n\r\nTentative high level outline - \r\n\r\n1. API Gateway and Lambda - demonstrate a Serverless endpoint, wherein we can see arbitrary code execution in response to an HTTP POST, in the context of a Lambda, which simply parrots back the body and one or two headers, to show how they can be mapped into the function. Discuss using the API Gateway as a passthrough to an existing REST API, to allow for the swapping out, endpoint by endpoint, to a serverless one, in the event of a legacy app.\r\n\r\n2. Data storage options - largely high level discussion of considerations between Elasticache, DynamoDB, and S3 as storage mechanisms, in terms of cost, ease of use, and availability/consistency guarantees.\r\n\r\n3. Backend processing and user notification - Discuss lambda event sources and their implications (the ability to trigger lambdas from writes to Dynamo or S3, a brief foray into SQS as a distributed queue, and how things can fail, and what to do about them). Demonstrate using AWS IoT for websocket pushes to web clients (and mention GCM and APNS as still being available for pushing to mobile). Discuss SNS as an option to broadcast events to custom HTTP endpoints, or to send emails, as well as a possible way to send mobile push messages.\r\n\r\n4. Access Control - Discuss Cognito as an Amazon provided identity provider. Demonstrate how to go from a Cognito identity (or a custom identity, if using custom code to log someone in) to a set of temporary AWS credentials, that can be used to access resources. A brief foray into IAM policies (which control what a set of AWS credentials have access to). And how to leverage both IAM and AWS credentials to properly secure one's own REST API endpoints.\r\n\r\n5. CI/CD - Discuss some of the frameworks for developing and deploying serverless code to AWS. Demonstrate an example using the Serverless (http://www.serverless.com/) framework. Demonstrate Cloudformations as a way to define and port infrastructure between environments. Suggest the use of AWS Config and Cloudtrail to track changes. \r\n\r\n6. Monitoring - Dive into Cloudwatch. Demonstrate executing lambdas, navigating the resulting logs, exporting to S3 for ingesting into another tool. Demonstrate available metrics, and how to set up alarms. Discuss integration points with tools we've used.\r\n\r\n7. Latency and Cloudfront- Discuss latency of lambdas. How real it is, how to mitigate it, when to cache. Demonstrate setting up a Cloudfront instance in front of custom API, and when to use it vs the API Gateway's cache. \r\n\r\n","abstract":"This talk is to introduce Serverless computing, a new paradigm in the cloud for deploying applications that requires no server administration, and which scales transparently in both function and cost.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. The first sentence of the description implicates a causal relation that I believe doesn't exist (\"With the release of AWS Lambda and API Gateway, it has become possible to build RESTful interfaces without any server infrastructure in the cloud\").  One can build REST interfaces for enterprise systems on-premises for the intranet, without AWS Lambda or API Gateway. In any case, if you're using AWS Lambda, I think you *are* using cloud infrastructure, you just don't need to procure/manage/be aware of the servers.  \r\n\r\n2. In the notes you say \"I intend to cover the basics of building REST interfaces.\" Do you mean REST API design? That's a quite large topic on its own.  \r\n\r\n3. In addition to benefits, I think you should also discuss the challenges and drawbacks of serverless architecture. Such discussion flows naturally into motivation for and risks associated with serverless. \r\n\r\n4. A 90-minute long talk takes the time equivalent to 3 30-minute talks, so the info should be clearly valuable. Serverless is a hot topic this year and many people want to know what it is, if it's a good fit for them, what's the roadmap to 'go serverless'. I think your talk goes over all of that. Do you intend to talk about serverless outside AWS? For example, simple use of MBaaS for mobile app authentication?  \r\n\r\n5. In the notes section, consider including an outline of your talk, even if it’s only tentative.\r\n\r\n6. What is \"event pipelining\"? Is there a more commonly used equivalent term? Maybe a term that's in wikipedia?  :^)\r\n\r\n7. Just to clarify, what's the presentation mechanics? Slide-based presentation end-to-end? Or do you plan  to have a demo? Or is it a tutorial where participants will actually use their laptops to play with the technology? \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T19:04:36.959Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T19:04:36.959Z"},{"id":3757,"submission_id":8090,"talk_id":15375,"user":{"name":"Christopher Phillips","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ee258f073df1844949be0ce18d5926dd?s=500","email":"lostcolony@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks so much for your input!

This presentation suggests a simple process you can follow to perform a rapid assessment of any software architecture effort regardless of its size, complexity or stage of development. The focus is on capturing the most critical aspects of the software architecture including: (a) Software Quality Attributes; (b) Key Architectural Decisions (including hardware platforms, software technology, development tools and reuse strategy); and (c) Architectural Design (primarily in the form of Unified Modeling Language or UML). Emphasis is placed on identifying and documenting references to existing artifacts. It generally requires an interview with the most knowledgeable software engineer on the proposal, development or maintenance team to identify the location of artifacts that are available and information that has never been documented. This is basically a two-day process. On the first day information is gathered and quickly recorded. On the second day, the information is analyzed, expert opinion(s) formulated, and a report is prepared and disseminated to all of the relevant Stakeholders.

The involved systems fulfill valid purposes in their own right, can operate separately and are managed for their own purpose rather than the purposes of the whole.\r\n\r\nAllocation of business functions to specific system components and definition of interfaces with significant consequences for architecture of such large and complex IT and software system-of-systems (SoS) is a challenge. It requires data supporting decision criteria and accommodating fast evolution of the architecture in the agile organization.  \r\n\r\nRoche Customized Method of Architecting SoS \r\n===========================================\r\n\r\nFor the architecting of the system-of-systems in Roche product context a customized method was defined based on the US Department of Defense Architecture Framework.\r\n\r\nThis method involves 6 steps with start/finish criteria and deliverables for each. I will illustrate these steps using examples from Roche.\r\n\r\n1.  Business process Domain Analysis (identification of Business Drivers, Business Capabilities, Business Functions, Constraints, elaboration of User Stories and Workflows, definition of Quality Attributes).\r\n\r\n2.  Integrated Dynamic Modeling (IDM) for multiple workflows within the business process.\r\n\r\n3.  Derivation of Events, Activities and Resources for each workflow IDM.\r\n\r\n4.  Alignment to elaborate Common Events, Common Activities and Common Resources for all modelled workflows.\r\n\r\n5.  Identification of existing/overlapping/missing functionality (based on Activities) and data and processors (based on Resources) in involved systems. Preliminary allocation of the functions to the systems and verification of fulfillment of Business Criteria (based on Domain Analysis).\r\n\r\n6.  Architecting of data, process, deployment, … models and preliminary design of interface between the involved systems.  Verification of Quality Attributes fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThis method can be applied in agile projects, if the sprints are oriented on implementation of workflow.\r\n\r\nResults of application of the method at Roche\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\nThe customized method for the architecting of system-of-systems was applied to business processes related to Remote Solutions and IoT. It led to quick definition of models and derived data supporting the decision making and allocation of business functions and resources to existing and to be developed systems as well as identification of common resources and interfaces for their exchange. \r\n\r\n","notes":"As author of this method and part of the team applying it in the real world large scale projects I can give the practitioners view and probably answer most of questions. \r\nMy talk at the SATURN 2016 related to multiple ATAMs gave a short introduction to a small subset of the entire system.","abstract":"Customized method for making architecture decisions of allocation business functions to specific components of the system-of-systems and definition of interfaces for large and complex IT and software.  \nThis method of 6 steps with start/finish criteria for each was successfully applied at Roche.","audience_level":"All","talk_format":"Experience Report Presentation (30 minutes)"},"ratings":[{"id":27470,"submission_id":7950,"value":100,"comments":"","created_at":"2017-01-30T12:38:56.192Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T12:38:56.192Z","user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"}},{"id":27214,"submission_id":7950,"value":100,"comments":"I like that he's introducing the method (whose components won't be new to SATURN audience) and the real business application.

I have a few suggestions/comments from the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program: \r\n\r\n1. You say \"million connection points\" to characterize a large scale system. Would there be a different metrics unit people are more familiar with? LOC maybe? \r\n\r\n2. I hope you use examples to explain each of the steps. In fact, if you do so, I think you should say that in the description, that is, say something like... \"using real-life examples, I'll explain the 6 steps...\"\r\n\r\n3. One may look at the description and ask: 'Sounds promising. But we use scrum/agile development in a low ceremony way. Would this work for me?'  So, is this approach applicable to Agile development? With a small co-located team working on a single system and doing short sprints? If not, that's ok. If you see value, you may want to mention that in the description.\r\n\r\n3. If I had to guess, I'd say that some of these steps take time and require significant modeling and documentation effort. My feeling from experience is that developers will not be very keen on doing that. How much automation can be employed in the process? How long does it take? Is it hours in facilitated meetings with stakeholders like in QAW or ATAM?  Maybe the description can say something about the feasibility and cost required to use the process. \r\n\r\n4. The second paragraph is one long sentence. If you break it up it gets easier to parse.\r\n\r\n5. Just terminology: what you describe in step 1 as business process domain analysis seems to focus on functionality. To me that's business process modeling. To me domain analysis would necessarily encompass definition of business entities. An example of technique for domain analysis would be Eric Evans' DDD.  \r\n\r\n6. By the way, how are business capabilities different from business functions? If they're close enough, you can remove one to make the talk description shorter. \r\n\r\n\r\nTypo: \"and derived data*,* supporting the decision making ** and allocation \"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-30T12:37:09.362Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T12:37:09.362Z"},{"id":3932,"submission_id":7950,"talk_id":15115,"user":{"name":"Andrzej Knafel, Ph.D.","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ad6ad0b2d3de9e777d1f16d79c14132c?s=500","email":"andrzej.knafel@roche.com"},"body":"Hi Paulo\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your comments.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. I work in enterprise IT. In our organization, all new IT software projects now use microservices and docker, but more than half of the developers have not yet created anything in this new world. Many organizations are in a similar situation. I hope in your talk you make a reflection about what are the benefits of moving to microservices and containers, and what are the challenges and risks. Talks on this topic typically emphasize the good things, but often neglect to mention the difficulties. \r\n\r\n2. One of the topics is \"Tips for integrating containers into complex existing environments, supporting the hybrid state of microservices and monolithic applications.\" I hope you explain what would be the motivation and criteria to move existing complex monolithic application to containers. We have for the moment discarded that option in our organization because of cost and complexity. We have found it useful at times to take cuts of a monolith and repackage as containerized microservices that expose http endpoints though.\r\n\r\n3. Minor point... Your last topic is \"Putting an end to Shadow-IT.\"  Here's what wikipedia says about shadow IT: \"Shadow IT is a term often used to describe information-technology systems and solutions built and used inside organizations without explicit organizational approval. It is also used, along with the term 'Stealth IT', to describe solutions specified and deployed by departments other than the IT department.\" So, people using gmail instead of the corporate email system is \"shadow IT\", and I see how that's a problem. But it seems this derogatory term also applies to software applications developed by non-IT groups. Well, I think that's a great idea if put forth with some direction. My organization has had for years a successful program for decentralized software application development. Many end users now develop great solutions, and are given access to IT-managed databases when needed.  \r\n\r\n4. The term visibility is not clear to me in \"while ensuring visibility, security, governance and compliance\".\r\n\r\nTypo: \"recommended t*o*pologies and patterns\".\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T14:21:15.541Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T14:21:15.541Z"}]}},{"id":8029,"submission":{"id":8029,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-14T01:22:59.118Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:47:28.004Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":90.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["30-minute-talk","micro services architecture"],"profile":{"name":"Sairam Tadigadapa","bio":"\r\n\r\nI am a Director of Software Engineering at Capital One.

My focus in on Marketing and Decisioning Technologies. I am in their Richmond, VA location.  I lead a team of 70 engineers developing architecture, building APIs and devops platforms. Over the last couple of years we built several mission critical APIs most of them are for customer facing and highly regulated capabilities. We learnt a lot breaking a monolithic application into micro services. I led delivery of several enterprise APIs and deployed into production. Hope to share my experiences in the session. I will also have some time for questions and answers at the end. The talk should last for 30 min.\r\nI will be explaining the following success factors and considerations\r\n\r\nWhy did we go with micro services?\r\n\r\nThe initiative that I led was a regulatory project for Know Your Customer (KYC) regulation. It has very tight timelines and dependencies across the organization. The best way we could have accomplished the timelines is to go with a microservices architecture. So the business drivers for microservices architecture are\r\n\r\n- Ability to break the solution into manageable micro services and have small teams solve them. That increased the speed of development by taking advantage of public cloud, strong devops, and automated testing\r\n- To drive accountability and ownership in a cross enterprise initiative\r\n- We also wanted to break some capabilities away from a monolithic application that was getting difficult to change\r\n\r\nSo, it is the business imperatives that drove us towards the micro services architecture.\r\n\r\nIn general, if it is a differentiating capability for the business (say credit decisioning for a bank) and agility is important, microservices approach helps. If it is not a differentiating capability like payroll and HR, better stick to a vendor product.\r\n\r\nArchitecture:\r\n\r\n- When re-architecting a monolithic application, we achieved better success starting with the head (or customer facing functions) of the monolithic application. As we get deeper there will be more dependencies making it difficult to decompose the application.\r\n- It is important to Identify the business capability and design the contract accordingly. The architecture should be aligned with product owner and it should clearly articulate the problem the specific micro service is solving.\r\n- Use domain driven design as much as possible. It is important to define the domain and the bounded context for the micro service. This also helps to define the granularity of the micro service. If the service is too big, it replicates the monolithic. Maintainability and agility should be kept in mind while designing the micro service. Our definition of a bounded context was driven by the following:\r\n  - Autonomy of the domain, its business context, and self-contained data store without need for replication across microservices\r\n  - The domain is simple to explain\r\n  - In one instance performance dictated its domain. We separated a high performing calculation engine as its own microservice and developed it in GO language.\r\n- Architect should focus on the API contract, interplay of micro services, and ensuring the non-functional requirements are met. It is important for the architect to know where to stop in the design\r\n- What you design for real time may not work for batch. We first designed the microservices for real time first with a requirement of low throughput. But when we started using the microservices for batch use cases that had a higher throughput requirement, the infrastructure design did not work. So, we had to tune and scale up the microservices.\r\n- While building individual microservices was easy, orchestrating the services wasn&#39;t easy. We built Java orchestrations, but very soon the orchestration services became too big to manage. We are experimenting with reactive frameworks.\r\n\r\nDevops :\r\n\r\n- Benefit of micro services is speed of development. Unless the code migration and deployment is automated, it is difficult to manage a micro services factory\r\n- Automate integration testing and performance testing. We built automated testing for individual APIs, but did not build automated integration scripts. That became a bottleneck at the end as we had to do manual testing.\r\n- With micro services, there will be frequent release. Hence, doing blue green deployment helps to minimize the down time\r\n- A cloud first approach works better for micro services\r\n- ATDD is a mandatory practice for micro services\r\n\r\nBest practices and culture:\r\n\r\n- Encourage Small teams of 4-5. If a micro service takes more than 1-2 developer to understand fully, it is too big and will become unmanageable\r\n- Encourage pair programming\r\n- Encourage knowledge sharing. Leverage demos to ensure teams get the big picture. Otherwise, developers will know only their micro service and miss the big picture. We moved away from separate production support teams. Teams support what they build. When we deployed the microservices into production, initially it was difficult to support as developers did not have the entire architecture context.\r\n- With small teams, teams slowly have to graduate to full stack teams that can do everything the micro service needs.\r\n\r\nCommunication to stakeholders:\r\n\r\n- It is important to communicate to clients often and in detail. Write a blog and publish every detail\r\n- Version management is critical\r\n- Contract first design helps in better communication\r\n\r\nOther practical considerations\r\n\r\n- Level of granularity is very important. Be ready to redefine and re-architect often as you go along\r\n- It is impossible to have a separate support team to whom you hand off the micro- sevices after they are built. The eco system gets more complex for some other team to own manage. integrate support into delivery teams\r\n- Alerting and monitoring is extremely important. Automate to the extent delivery teams spend less than 10% of their time on production support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","abstract":"This talk will explain  lessons learnt with micro services architecture, what are the key success factors like cloud, devops, domain driven design, and the practical considerations like production support issues and increased complexity.\n","audience_level":"All","talk_format":"DEV@SATURN Talk (15 minutes)"},"ratings":[{"id":27153,"submission_id":8029,"value":100,"comments":"","created_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:18.406Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:18.406Z","user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"}},{"id":26820,"submission_id":8029,"value":100,"comments":"This looks like a great session based on experience at an established organisation, full of good advise","created_at":"2017-01-27T14:23:00.887Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T14:23:00.887Z","user":{"name":"Chris Cooper-Bland","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f238825a57dff36da715f337d78053ec?s=500","email":"ccb@badgerscroft.com"}},{"id":25470,"submission_id":8029,"value":50,"comments":"this looks like a great experience report with a lot of good advice.

Things I like about this talk: there is a ton of good advice born from real experience covering a range of topic areas that all have to work to get microservices working.  Things I worry about with this talk: there are a ton of topics to cover in 30 minutes and some of it is common advice that has been around for a few years now.\r\n\r\nI generally like what you've proposed and appreciate the focus on lessons based on your experience.  My advice, if this talk is accepted, is to try to tighten the focus and reduce scope or to think about ways to \"chunk\" your advice for easier consumption.  Also think about how you'll reinforce your advice with examples from your experience.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. For reflection: not everybody who's creating microservices uses DDD. What's in DDD that helps to define the best size (actually, the most appropriate functional scope) for a microservice? \r\n\r\n2. Should all microservices match DDD BCs? \r\n\r\n3. What are the challenges of using microservices? Is microservice architecture the best option in all cases? If not, in what situations a more monolithic approach works better? \r\n\r\n4. It seems your lessons learned derive from redesigning (breaking up) a monolithic application into microservices. What's the motivation for doing that? In the organization I work for, new projects are using microservices. However, for the moment, we have discarded the option of redesigning monolithic applications into microservices because of cost and complexity. We have found it useful at times to take cuts of a monolith and repackage as containerized microservices that expose http endpoints though. \r\n\r\n5. You say \"Benefit of micro services is speed of development\". I don't disagree, but I hope you can explain why in your talk. As food for thought, I wrote a [blog post](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2015/11/microservices-beyond-the-hype-what-you-gain-and-what-you-lose.html) about benefits and challenges of microservices. There I argue why you can see improved modifiability with microservices, which is a factor for improving productivity.  \r\n\r\n6. I think the community is settling on a single word spelling for microservice. That's how it's spelled in wikipedia as well. :^)\r\n\r\nTypos: \r\n\r\n- \"more dependencies *that* make it difficult\"\r\n\r\n- \"It is important *to i*dentify the business\"\r\n\r\n- \"*The* architecture should be\"\r\n\r\n- \"ATDD is a mandatory *practice* for micro services\"\r\n\r\n- \"everything the micro service need*s*\"\r\n\r\n- \"Communication to stake**holders\"\r\n\r\n- \"Level of granularity is very important.* B*e ready to\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:11.242Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T17:06:11.242Z"},{"id":3738,"submission_id":8029,"talk_id":15249,"user":{"name":"Sairam Tadigadapa","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a5e942ea5ba423a74c096ead2641c67c?s=500","email":"sairam78@gmail.com"},"body":"Paulo,\r\nThank you very much feedback.

I have a few suggestions/comments: \r\n\r\n1. The relation between agile development and architecture work has been examined and discussed for a decade. I'm curious to see your OODA approach. Indeed, I think you should name it in the talk description and make sure it is well described in the talk. \r\n\r\n2. As a sanity check, ask yourself if the approach works well for geographically distributed and/or outsourced teams. Also ask if it requires developers who are well versed in software design (in addition to architects who can code of course). \r\n\r\n3. Years ago I gave an interview to InfoQ. One of the questions was exactly about the topic of your talk. I'll reproduce here my answer. It's just food for thought for preparing your presentation...  \r\n\r\n\"It is a well known misconception that agile development means no documentation. In fact, as a [survey shows](http://www.ambysoft.com/surveys/modelingDocumentation2008.html), agile teams are more likely to model than traditional teams. A few things that agile architects (or perhaps any software architect) should remember: \r\n\r\nThe key aspect of design/modeling in agile projects is not to avoid designing, but to avoid \"big-design up-front\" (BDUF). In general, high-level architectural strategies should be worked out up front, but many design decisions and design details can be left to when you need them. \r\n\r\nOnly produce design documentation that will fulfill a need of the stakeholders. Stop designing as soon as you're ready to start coding. In the next sprint you can expand/refine the existing design as needed in order to capture design decisions required by next sprint's features. \r\n\r\nIf it's not worth updating the design, throw it away. Some design diagrams are used to guide implementation, but at the end the code sometimes looks different from the diagram. If you don't have time to update the diagram to reflect the implementation, it's better to remove it than keeping an out-of-date diagram that may confuse a future reader. \r\n\r\nMany times, sketches are all you need. Don't spend too much time crafting the neatest diagram using the latest and richest notation available. Don't spend too much money on sophisticated modeling tools if you just need a drawing tool. In many agile projects, especially the ones with small, co-located teams, the true value of design diagrams comes from drawing them, which forces you to think through the issues; once the issues are solved, the diagrams lose much of their value. Many times the design is represented as a sketch on a whiteboard or piece of paper. If the sketch can be used to successfully convey the design to the team, that sketch, as is, can be *the* diagram in your architecture view. Why not?\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-28T16:21:52.816Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T16:21:52.816Z"}]}},{"id":7920,"submission":{"id":7920,"state":"accepted","confirmed":true,"created_at":"2017-01-11T21:00:19.114Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:55:02.620Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":80.0,"trust":50.0,"tag_list":["code-quality"],"profile":{"name":"G.

You'll also see that because there's no \"cost of entry\" / increment for methods, high class-level Cognitive Complexity is a reliable indicator that a class contains a lot of logic, not just a lot of methods. That is, you can use Cognitive Complexity to sift domain classes from the logic-intense classes that impose a higher maintenance burden.\r\n\r\nCognitive Complexity is already available as a new rule in some Sonar code analyzers, and should be available throughout the SonarQube ecosystem by the end of 2017.","notes":"30min Tech Talk\r\n\r\nSonarSource (the company behind [SonarQube](http://sonarqube.org)) is introducing a new way of measuring complexity: [Cognitive Complexity](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cognitive-complexity-because-testability-understandability/), which gives a far more accurate measurement of the relative understandability of a method than Cyclomatic Complexity. \r\n\r\nI'll cover these topics:\r\n* Cyclomatic Complexity: what it's good for and what's it's not, i.e. why a new standard/metric is needed\r\n* Cognitive Complexity: motivations, specifics, benefits\r\n* How to use Cognitive Complexity to guide refactoring.

I think it's fair to assume you're proposing a 30-minute technical talk (talks are 15, 30 or 90 minutes long at SATURN this year).\r\n\r\nI have a few comments/suggestions:\r\n\r\n- It may have gone unnoticed, but the Abstract and the Description don't mention automation anywhere. I'm familiar with cyclomatic complexity, we use sonarqube in our organization, and we follow the \"automate all the things\" motto. I was reading the description and wondering if cognitive complexity could be something analyzable by sonarqube (or other static code analysis tool). When I read in the Description that in this talk I would learn a method to calculate a Cognitive Complexity score, then I imagined the worst: 'it's not automated yet.'  Only when I saw the notes I realized it's automated and, better yet, part of sonarqube. \r\nSo, my suggestion is to make clear in the Description that this approach is automated. I think you should also mention it will be part of the sonarqube ecosystem soon. \r\n\r\n- You may already be planning to, but I suggest clarifying whether cognitive complexity should replace or complement cyclomatic complexity analysis. In other words, in my quality index formula, should I use both, maybe with different weights?  \r\n\r\n- SATURN is focused on software architecture and different code analyses bring a lot of design insight. So, I also suggest drawing a connection between cognitive complexity and design quality. \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-18T02:47:12.638Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T02:47:12.638Z"},{"id":3401,"submission_id":7615,"talk_id":14500,"user":{"name":"G.

In particular, a dependable CPS responds correctly and timely even in situations where system parts have failed, either temporarily or permanently. This requirement also applies when tests check reliability, availability and performance properties of these systems in the lab and in the field. A CPS with test probes built-into all HW/SW-components throughout the CPS lifecycle can fulfill these requirements. Applied to an eCar, non-intrusive, deterministic fault-injection tests executed by test probes provide strong evidence for statements like: “While driving, the eCar can safely be steered when a fault fails a central, redundant HW/SW component that executes steering operations”.\r\n\r\nTests of such systems and properties pose various challenges, for example (1) stimulating selected CPS parts with correct data and with faulty data in rare and critical situations, (2) checking selected CPS parts at selected points in time, or during time intervals according to focused and measurable test goals, (3) differentiation of the CPS's treatment of temporary and permanent faults, and (4) absolute non-disturbance of the tested system's functionality or timing. The fourth challenge applies in particular to fault-injection tests that check CPS safety, or that operate near the border between the CPS and the physical process.\r\n\r\nMeeting the challenges outlined above requires that the architecture of the system under evaluation be designed for testability. Starting from here, we first characterize the CPS we use as an example: an integration platform of an X-by-wire eCar (www.projekt-race.de/en). This motivates the need for reliable statements on the real-time behavior of the system from different tests, from which we derive testability requirements. Afterwards, we elaborate a series of design tactics that enable or improve the system’s testability, focusing on test probes. A test probe is a kind of Built-in Monitor (SEI: Testability tactic) or Maintenance Interface (R. Hanmer: Patterns for fault-tolerant systems) with particular demands in probe environments. When these demands are fulfilled, test probes can execute deterministic, efficient and reliable real-time tests, or act as safety monitors that observe and potentially intervene in a system.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the system domain you will learn two key aspects: how to design a testable system that incorporates test probes as central system elements, and how to write non-intrusive tests that yield reliable results.","notes":"","abstract":"We discuss the practical use of novel HW/SW test probes to non-intrusively check functional, performance, and safety properties in fault-tolerant cyber-physical systems.

The word “stream” implies a continuous process, but in real life that stream is far from homogeneous. Architects (or whoever else owns the design decisions) find themselves making decisions with widely varying impact, based on information with differing levels of uncertainty, throughout the life of a software solution. On top of that, the way these decisions and their impact are communicated evolves as the audience and the focus of the architectural communication change.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we explore the metaphor of a human lifetime to illustrate various aspects of architectural decision making, throughout a software solution’s life cycle. Amid all the fluidity of the stream of design decisions, we will look for anchor points with common concerns to address and recurring communication needs. We will see how the nature of architectural decisions changes when we go from birth (the first architectural outline) to graduation (making the business case), and find guidance on communicating the architecture at times of life-defining milestones like marriage (committing to the architecture) and revolutionary changes to the solution. The points will be illustrated by real-life examples from an interesting case study.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial is based on Risk- and Cost-Driven Architecture, a popular approach to improve architecture practices in both traditional and agile contexts, with the aim of providing “just enough anticipation” in the architecture. No prior knowledge of RCDA is required to attend.","notes":"This is a 90-minute tutorial.\r\n\r\nDuring the product lifecycle, key aspects of architectural decisions change, depending on the life stage:\r\n\r\n* level of risk and cost control: the cone of uncertainty\r\n* available information to base architectural decisions on\r\n* impact of architectural decisions\r\n* number of architectural decisions\r\n* cost of change to the architecture\r\n\r\nCertain milestones like graduation (approving the business case for the solution) and marriage (the moment after which it becomes very expensive to change the architecture) occur in every solution life cycle. Such milesones lead to standard stakeholder concerns, like affordability, level of risk control and predictability. We use the commonality of these concerns to provide the architect with standard views in their documentation, enabling them to show how the architecture addresses these common concerns.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n1.

Through examples, you'll learn the basics of the SonarQube custom check API. \r\n\r\n- how to enforce the architecture continuously by integrating the custom rules to your CI infrastructure. \r\n\r\n- how to make this setup effective, based on lessons learned by the author in the past 6 years. \r\n\r\nNo pre-requisite knowledge is required other than basic understanding of object-oriented programming. \r\n","notes":"This talk is supposed to be a 90-minute tech tutorial. \r\n\r\nEarly results of the approach discussed in the presentation were described in a [SATURN blog post](https://saturnnetwork.wordpress.com/2012/11/26/ultimate-architecture-enforcement-prevent-code-violations-at-code-commit-time/). \r\nMore recent results were described in a [SPLASH Wavefront paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2508433).\r\nThe SATURN presentation is updated to reflect recent improvements and results.\r\n\r\n*Session mechanics* \r\n\r\nThis is a slide-based presentation. I'll also use the IDE to show and run some code. Questions and comments are welcome during the talk or at the end. \r\n\r\n*Talk outline*\r\n\r\n- Introduction: Motivation for architecture conformance; factors that lead to lack of conformance; consequences of lack of conformance.\r\n- Creating a custom rule: intro to static code analysis tools with an API to create custom rules\r\n- Example 1 - enforcing a layered architecture (for each example, we'll examine the code and comment on the SonarQube API)\r\n- Example 2 - enforcing mandated generalizations\r\n- Example 3 - enforcing REST service design standards\r\n- Automated tests for custom checks: quick overview of how to build and run automated tests\r\n- Integration with continuous integration\r\n- Running critical checks in a pre-commit hook on git or svn\r\n- Our experience with custom checks: results and lessons learned in 6 years \r\n\r\n*Target audience*\r\n\r\nThis talk is particularly important to software architects, but is of interest to software developers in general. \r\n\r\n*Previous presentations* \r\n\r\nSPLASH 2013; The Brazilian Conference on Software - Theory and Practice 2013; 3er Congreso Internacional Escuela de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación (Peru); invited talks at different organizations.\r\n","abstract":"The architecture carefully created is often not entirely followed in the implementation.
