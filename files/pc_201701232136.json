The topic sounds interesting and pragmatic.\r\n\r\nFrom the guidelines for the conference could you please elaborate on how the topic is related to one of the topic themes for this year's conference. Link given at the end for your reference.\r\n\r\nOne of the themes talk about “how to ensure that architecture work gets done in environments without formal architect roles”. Is the talk about role of the Team Lead in an environment with or without a formal Architect? Also, what is not fully clear is whether the talk is about some of the management related activities a technical lead need to do or much on the technical side with or without an Architect.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there is a theme that talks about “developing software architects, including coaching, mentoring, certification, professional training, and college education”. Is that the area the topic is going top focus.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to split the talk on roles and responsibilities of the technical lead without the interviewing aspects, as that would allow better focus for the limited time.

Making the systems Secure by Design, something really relevant for architects. We saw that Product Owners consulted the security team and architects way more for advice when designing new systems, they gave room and time to developers to write secure code, and discussions between the Security and development teams were actually constructive.

I will try to answer your questions below and give some additional information.\r\n\r\nAbout what I will tell about how we embedded a security culture in the company:\r\nSo how do you already get that security mindset embedded in earlier stages. How do you get people excited to think about security? Security has the prejudice that it is boring, that is something you have to do, maybe because someone else says so. Like the security team/department. But security can also be fun! Fun? Yes! By stimulating the employees to think like a hacker, either technical or functional, they got motivated to think of security requirements by approaching it from the other side. This in combination with the right tools really helped to get our security level to high standards.\r\n\r\nSome more information about the Abuser Story Workshop:\r\nWith abuser stories we touch on a subject everybody worked with: user stories. Normally with user stories you define new functionality that you develop with the customer in mind. But how can this functionality be abused? We stimulate the colleagues creativity to think evil and create a hacker mindset for themselves. Turn it around: write an Abuser story: As a hacker, I want…, So that… We were surprised by the evilness of our colleagues – we had some real hackers among us. We do this by introducing a simple proces, let one team think about abuser stories (so how could you as a hacker abuse this functionality), and the other team about user stories on how to avoid abuse. After that the 'Attacking' team presents its abuser stories, which the other team needs to 'Defend' with one of their user stories. We then stimulate the Product Owners to braintorm about abuser stories at the kickoff of each new functionality, more or less facilitate their own workshop. The outcome is then translated in requirements for the different user stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are actually two ways of how you can approach this talk. \r\n\r\n1. A (comprehensive) talk about the journey of bol.com and how we embedded a security culture, where I will deep dive more in how we did this with the use of Abuser Story Workshops. This focusses more on how we created this security culture, and the lessons we learned from this proces.\r\n\r\n2. A short talk about the journey of bol.com and how we embedded a security culture, and facilitating a Abuser Story Workshop to illustrate how we did this. This focusses more on teaching you how you could facilitate these workshops yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\nRelevance for audience: the first is relevant for a broader audience, where the second talk (workshop form) is more relevant for Analysts and Product Owners.\r\n\r\nI hope this gives you more insights. If you have any questions or you want me to elaborate a bit more, just let me know.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJim","created_at":"2017-01-05T10:15:16.558Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T10:15:16.558Z"},{"id":3126,"submission_id":7384,"talk_id":14092,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks, Jim.

However, I'm not so interested in the implementation details.\r\n\r\nI would love to see a talk provide an good, practical overview of the topic for the architect.  This is an area of debate for architects, so I think it is a very relevant field for discussion.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the first addition of \"Software Architecture in Practice\" the statement was made: \"Making a system's user interface clear and easy to use is primarily a matter of getting the details of a user's interaction correct … but these details are not architectural.\"\r\n\r\nIn later editions this position was retracted with a section called \"Usability Mea Culpa (or that’s not Architecture)\" but other architects still disagree.  Consider this blog post that insists that usability is important, but still not architecture: http://enterprise-it-architecture.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/usability-is-not-architecture-quality.html\r\n\r\nAs somebody with a passion for and experience of achieving accessibility, could you explain to architects why this is an important quality attribute and the role that architects play in improving it?\r\n\r\nIf you could include some well defined quality scenarios [1] and relevant architectural tactics [2] that would be very desirable.  The testing approach would be covered by the tactics and you might want to focus on this in particular.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this would be quite a deviation from your current proposal.  You may think of something closer to what you already have that will help to convince architects that this is something they need to be interested in.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=4\r\n[2] http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1959673&seqNum=5\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:26.301Z"}]},{"id":8060,"state":"submitted","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2017-01-15T05:42:07.234Z","updated_at":"2017-01-15T05:42:07.234Z","additional_info":"N/A","rating":78.5714285714286,"trust":100.0,"tag_list":[],"profile":{"name":"Pradyumn Sharma","bio":"32 years of experience in IT industry.

This approach explains\r\n\t      (i) How alignment is the part of architectural work where an architect makes sure that the solution fits its mission?\r\n\t      (ii) How distilling the direction of change, and designing the domain essence are explicit architectural activities?\r\n\t      (iii) How creating the detailed structure, and designing the domain essence can be done in an emergent way\r\n2.\tTrace the history of software development practices from waterfall phases through iterative design to agile techniques.

Agile architecting is a topic of interest as development times continue to shorten.\r\n\r\nCould you explain more about what type of agile development you are addressing? You have mention \"agile software development process\" (lowercase agile) and \"Agile Practices\" (uppercase Agile). There can be differences, and audience members may make incorrect assumptions. Will the talk address how architecting activities relate to some specific Agile methods (for example, sprints) or is it more about architecting in a less strictly defined but still rapidly changing environment?\r\n\r\nIt may be difficult to present all the proposed content in 15 minutes. The abstract describes five topics, some with subtopics. If you need to shorten it, I suggest that the history information (waterfall to iterative to agile) could be trimmed out. That is information audience members can find in other places (for example, on the Web).\r\n\r\nHow you specifically combined architecting tasks and work produces with agile timelines, and how you are able to continually revise the architecture without big tear ups and lost work will be most valuable to audience members. I suggest a focus on those aspects (that is, your topic 3).\r\n\r\nFor which track is this talk proposed? Track 1 or 3 seem applicable.","created_at":"2017-01-18T15:55:40.712Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T15:55:40.712Z"},{"id":3448,"submission_id":8186,"talk_id":15555,"user":{"name":"Babu Samuel","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6e279ebeacbe1385d2663141e1251642?s=500","email":"bsamuel25@gmail.com"},"body":"Thank you for the feedback. Please see below my answers to your questions.\r\n\r\nIn this topic, I was trying to address how architecting activities relate to Agile Software Development (ASD) methods (for example Scrum). In other words  how architects can be effective in iterative, incremental and evolutionary development . I agree that it is difficult to cover the topics I put in my abstract in 15 minutes. So I am thinking of concentrating what you proposed which is mostly on topic 3. So here I will concentrate more on how to continually revise the architecture without big tear ups and lost work or how to avoid design erosion.  \r\n\r\nI think this will fit on Track 1 (how architects can be effective in fast-moving, agile environments)\r\n\r\nSo here is my revised abstract on this topic.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, there is a question central to many discussions surrounding agile approaches to architecting software: In agile process, is the architecture of the system designed up-front, or does it emerge over time as the result of the agile software development process such as Scrum? However, according to the followers of Agile Software Development (ASD) methods, upfront design and evaluation of Software Architecture are likely to consume lot of time and effort without providing a valuable deliverables. The proponents of Software Architecture believe that sound architectural practices cannot be followed using agile approaches. This presentation shows how software architects embrace change by systematically altering design activities with iterative architecture assessment and refactoring.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-20T18:41:13.803Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T18:41:13.803Z"},{"id":3450,"submission_id":8186,"talk_id":15555,"user":{"name":"Anthony Tsakiris","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/646a039dcf3a2c4434f8fdf6c962b902?s=500","email":"adt2@speakeasy.net"},"body":"Thanks for the reply!

We want them to evolve with the needs of the business, its customers and stakeholders, and to be resilient in the face of ever changing market conditions and the external environment. This level of adaptability and responsiveness needs to be supported by the architecture of the systems we create. The complexity of the environment that architects find themselves in is increasing in recent years, with cloud, DevOps, continuous deployment, micro services and other elements adding to the factors that architects must consider. With this growing complexity, architects need to be supported by effective decision-making approaches.\r\n\r\nSize is also a factor. Larger systems and larger organizations have, by definition, a larger number of dependencies (internal and external) that must be managed, and a larger number of stakeholders (internal and external) whose needs must be addressed. The architecture of larger systems can involve hundreds or thousands of people, creating dozens to hundreds of products, components and subsystems that all need to work together. Maintaining the conceptual integrity of the architecture under such circumstances, and over time, presents many challenges and a greater need for coherence. \r\n\r\nTo navigate all of this, agile architects need to be adaptive; they need the ability to dynamically shift their decision-making approach to match the complexity of the circumstances they face. This session will describe how lessons from complexity science, and in particular, sense making and the Cynefin framework, can help architects to be more agile in how they work, and in turn, help them develop architectures that are more agile and adaptive to the needs of the organizations they serve.\r\n\r\n### Learning Outcomes\r\n* Applying sense making in the context of architecture\r\n* Applying the Cynefin framework to architecture problems and decisions\r\n* Examples of architecture problems and decisions that can be mapped to the different domains represented by the Cynefin framework (obvious, complicated, complex, chaotic and disorder)\r\n* How to manage the transition of architecture problems between these different domains\r\n* Implications for organization structure and communications\r\n* How such an approach leads to a more resilient architecture, and a more antifragile organization\r\n* How complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework supports emergent architecture\r\n* How complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework help the organization and the architecture to be more agile\r\n\r\n### Format\r\nFor a 90-minute workshop I typically use the following format. \r\n\r\nPart 1 (5 minutes):\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n* Overview of concepts\r\n\r\nPart 2 (10 minutes): \r\n\r\n* Architecture descriptions\r\n* Using narrative to understand architecture\r\n\r\nPart 3 (40 minutes):\r\n\r\n* Sense Making analysis of architectures and their influence on the organisation\r\n* Analysing the patterns that emerge from the sense making activity\r\n\r\nPart 4 (30 minutes):\r\n\r\n* The Cynefin Framework, and how it applies to architecture\r\n* Designing experiments\r\n\r\nPart 5 (5 minutes):\r\n\r\n* Debrief and wrap up\r\n\r\n","notes":"The majority of the session is highly participatory. All five parts outlined in the session description have some element of participation. Parts 2-4 are the major parts of the session.

At the heart of this is the concept of applying sensemaking and the Cynefin framework to managing the complexity faced by architects. That complexity is not just in the architecture itself, but also in the problem domain, the organization, and the wider context within which architects do their work.\r\n\r\nMy background is in software engineering and architecture, in the context of product and systems development, and in transforming engineering organizations around the world.

We can then relegate all interpretations of those events to subsystems that are easy to build, change, and replace when necessary. The resulting systems have single responsibilities and are decoupled from each other, which makes them simple to modify. Event Sourcing can enable us to move faster by supporting rapid experimentation with new perspectives, new user interactions, and new insights into our business.\r\n\r\nEvent Sourcing is agnostic of technology stack and language style, but it goes well with another pattern called CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation. In this talk, we will do a deep-dive into the two patterns and scope out a system that has:\r\n\r\n* Receiving and validating Commands that, if successful, result in Events (with pseudocode to illustrate how it might work).\r\n* Interpreting Events into denormalised projections for very fast reads.\r\n* Single responsibility services for reacting to Events by creating other events and, if necessary, triggering external behaviour.\r\n\r\nWe will also cover more in-depth topics, such as:\r\n\r\n* Strategies for evolving events and event schemas over time.\r\n* Dealing with eventual consistency.\r\n* Popular technologies for various system components, such as how to store and distribute events.","notes":"This is a 90 minute talk.

Anyway, there is a connection between Event Sourcing and EDA (imagine that the command itself arrives at the system as an event...), so I think it would be interesting to mention that connection in the tutorial, in case it fits within the information flow. \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-18T02:08:05.455Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T02:08:05.455Z"},{"id":3397,"submission_id":8185,"talk_id":15553,"user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"},"body":"Oops.

An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices","description":"An invisible app? An Introduction to Inclusive Design & Fundamental User Experience Best Practices\r\nI know what you're thinking. You want to know what the triple-A app titles already know. It's Inclusive Design, a process to deliver intuitive usability; it is the heart-and-soul of great User Experience and innovative interactions. Your app is in a cosmic battle with the Uninstall button; inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor. Appeal to your largest audience, provide cohesive experiences, and reduce development costs. It is an investment with one of the best returns in all of software. It's simple, cheap and awesome.\r\n\r\nApplication security is fundamental to software from initial design to every line developed. Security should not be an afterthought. Similarly, usability has this same ubiquity throughout the life-cycle of software. The fastest, most secure, most scalable software can end up in the trash because it misses the most important success criteria for any program in the universe - user acceptance. Software architecture profoundly impacts usability. Usability profoundly impacts acceptance. Architects may not choose app colors, error messages, and device layout, but they certainly make choices that enable and constrain designers options that make our software better. Like security is everyone’s responsibility at some level, so is usability at some level.\r\n\r\nWhat will attendees learn? Inclusive design isn’t only usability; it’s recognizing that your user base changes as their social and environmental contexts change. If your user is standing in the sun, waiting for a train in the snow, holding a baby, riding a bus, visiting a library or watching the big game in a sports bar, applications can account for the one type of user that, given a certain context, looks and acts like another type of user. Inclusive design helps developers understand these contexts. It applies these to our implementations to add modalities, flexibility in workflows, and intentional tolerance for user mistakes. Developers will learn to recognize contextual assumptions and apply new, potential contexts to their existing user base so they can serve them best while consequently serving a new, larger user base.

Not a problem, but it would avoid someone the confusion if you explicitly said UI desing somewhere (example: \"Inclusive UI Design\"). \r\n\r\n2) In the Description, it would be useful to qualify app as \"mobile app\" in at least one place. \r\n\r\n3) This sentence is not clear to me: \"inclusive design changes the nature of your app, tipping the scales in your favor.\"  I'm not sure changing the nature of my app is a goal to pursue.

In my experience this happens for a few reasons:  architecture documentation is rejected as being too heavyweight, documentation is typically out of sight and out of mind, and many developers don't know what to document.  Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), a lightweight documentation approach [proposed by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), solves these problems by recording design decisions in a simple markdown template in the same repository as the code affected by the ADR.  In this talk we will share our experiences and lessons using ADRs over the past year while working on multiple projects for IBM Watson.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk you will be able to create effective ADRs, introduce them to your team, and avoid common pitfalls with the method.","notes":"This talk is intended to be a 30 minute experience report.

It turns out to be a great way to\r\n           infuse the team with architectural thinking and train new architects\r\n   * Store ADRs with the code\r\n   * Works great with microservices where small groups of people and the code\r\n       they create work autonomously within a light governance framework\r\n   * Revisit old ADRs every so often to update them and ensure you have accurate reflection of current thinking\r\n6. Problems we ran into with ADRs and are still working through\r\n   * Plain text diagramming is a pain point.\r\n   * ADRs emphasize architectural decisions for a single component.  This is great for smaller projects and\r\n      individual microservices but falls apart when multiple architectural components stored in multiple code\r\n      repositories are involved.\r\n      * Our solution was to create an \"Architecture\" repository, which stored ADRs that cut across multiple\r\n         architectural components, linking to refinement ADRs as appropriate.\r\n   * Overemphasis on design decisions at the expense of other design documentation\r\n       * The team became awesome at recording ADRs to the point where they wouldn't document anything else!\r\n       * ADRs were smashing success.  Complementary methods that are as simple and lightweight are needed for\r\n          design concepts other than decisions.  examples: alternatives, governance policies, general design guidance,\r\n          quality attribute scenarios and other architecturally significant requirements\r\n7. Conclusion\r\n   * closing thoughts on using ADRs as a way to \"sneak in\" architecture\r\n   * great way to create a history of the project and explain not only where we are but how the system arrived at this point\r\n   * Show where ADRs fit as part of an documentation strategy \r\n   * Links to additional resources","abstract":"Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture key architectural design decisions in a lightweight, easy-to-create, plain text template stored in your existing version control system.

I am familiar with the Tyree/Ackermann paper.  I actually [referenced the same paper as a comment on the blog](http://disq.us/p/18d4i4r) about 8 months ago in an attempt to point out the same thing!  We also include a link to Nygard's blog and that paper in our ADR template as background information.\r\n\r\nI am certainly planning to make this connection in the talk, if accepted.  The two templates have the same goal in the end but collect slightly different information.  The ADR is significantly simpler, if nothing else.  I think a key difference and the thing that is kind of unique about Nygard's approach is in what is done with this information.  It sounds simple, but storing the design decisions in the version control system acted almost as a stealth way of injecting some of the ideas from Views and Beyond into the team.  What's more a small ecosystem of tools has sprung up around ADRs.  See https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools and https://github.com/holytshirt/dotnet-adr as examples.\r\n\r\nFinally, Thougtworks recently [classified ADRs as \"trial\" methodology](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records).

I first encountered the importance of maintaining Architectural Decisions ass a part of the SEI Views and Beyond book. I have been a great advocate and have used them ever since. I think its an important technique that needs good attention and would help many Architects attending the conference. The approach of understanding software architecture in terms of a variety of architecture decisions is now widely recognized.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do have a suggestion. Instead of the talk just focusing on ADR as suggested by Michael Nygard, what would be even useful is discussing the approaching of Documenting Architecture Decisions as a whole, which decisions to document and not, the payback/benefits and the variants available for documenting them along with your case study.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am concerned about the idea of just storing the Architecture Decisions in isolation without many other significant Architectural Artifacts. I understand that the Thoughtworks seems to recommend including them in the “trial” methodology. However, I am just concerned with the misnomer that these are the only set of significant artifacts for all cases.

I mentioned the points you raise under section 6.  I am certainly not suggesting this is the only set of artifacts required and recognize this is a trap teams easily fall into -- one of my teams did!\r\n\r\nWith respect to deciding when to document a decision vs. not, I plan to cover that under 5.4 and 5.5.  It turns out that people don't always know or recognize when an architectural decision has been made.  Pull requests and explicit architecture tasks combined with pairing was how we worked through some of those issues, in addition to including clear guidance in our template.  Basically we created situations for on the job training over time.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to attempt to place this technique within the context of the broader literature, as you suggest.  As you also point out, the idea of recording decisions is not new and is a commonly understood good practice.  The point of this talk is not to retread old ground but to look at good practice from the perspective of a newer method that people actually use and seems to resonate well with developers.  These ideas have been around for a while, and yet few teams practice them.  Why?  I think this method is another incremental step in the right direction.  By the end of the talk people will be armed with the knowledge they need to be successful with the method, not just try it out.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMichael","created_at":"2017-01-04T14:17:27.098Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T14:17:27.098Z"},{"id":3075,"submission_id":7391,"talk_id":14103,"user":{"name":"Yogeshwar Srikrishnan","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33bed537dc2a17123b3491737913e0a9?s=500","email":"yoga80@yahoo.com"},"body":"Thanks for the detail!

","description":"The software architect is the lone carrier of DNA for the vision of the product, but does not work alone. He/she is placed on a project (“situation”) where he/she must still deliver. The big band drummer can single handedly guide a band, and is placed on a gig (“situation”) where he/she must deliver. What is at the core of the big band drummer’s DNA to bring about success and what parallels might we draw between the two? Come and find out.\r\n\r\nSometimes the most efficient way to a fresh perspective is to sit in the seat of someone else from a totally unrelated field. Reading Harvard Business Review, competitive companies seek advice from totally unrelated fields to solve their most difficult problems. So why should it be any different for software architect?  The software architect’s role in leading teams and influencing business decisions cannot be overlooked. \r\n\r\nJohn Ryskowski would love to reveal the big band drummer’s strategy for success and its attendant parallels to the software architect’s “situation.”  Of course, band stories and drumming demonstrations will be included.\r\n","notes":"Session Requirements:\r\n1) To start a conversation that will last throughout the rest of the conference. \r\n2) To obtain a “fresh perspective” by taking folks down the path of a totally unrelated field and drawing pertinent parallels for and with them. \r\n3) As an architect one must create and nurture the vision for the DNA of the product, in spite of the project situation. The big band drummer must nurture a good sound from the big band, in spite of the gig situation. The parallels between the two should be realized, discussed, and brought to grounded historical experiences for each attendee. \r\n4) To introduce some new language that may help put project situations into perspective allowing one to return to clarity of thought. Psychologically speaking we get some relief from having name for some events or techniques. For example, I need to vary my intensity to get the group affect that I desire.\r\n\r\nThe session breakdown:\r\nHandouts: The actual drum chart for the subject of the talk- Kubis’ arrangement of “A Train,” and the “Clapping at Camp” chart written for audience participation. Big sticky papers will be on the walls of the room. \r\n\r\n1) Explain how one path to a fresh perspective is to experience something that is totally unrelated, but at the same time reveals grounded parallels to your situation. Executing a big band chart requires a strategy with known techniques but the flexibility to grab opportunities to inspire and transcend the moment. Through subtle and timely queues, the drummer can instill a sense of confidence and inspire the band to play better than they imagined. The techniques we discuss could have the same effect for the people on the architect’s project.\r\n2) Through demonstration, we discuss some of the possible variations the drum set can offer. This would include the elements of the drum set with each of their different sounds, the 4 limbs of the body, and just some of the combinations thereof. We will stick with the combinations that are most pertinent for this talk, and don’t forget the eyes and brain play a role as well. \r\n3) We get into a discussion about some of the situations the big band drummer must deal with. Does the band leader know little about music (or does the manager of the program or product owner know little about the technology)?  Does the lead trumpet think he is with the Count Bassie band (or is your development principle unaccustomed to this environment)? Can the bass player not play in time (or does your development principle have no sense of time)? Is the drum set in the absolute worst location to work with the rest of the band (or are you stuck without a reasonable means of communication with the rest of the team)? I will demonstrate how the big band drummer overcomes each of these situations. \r\nI then ask each member of the audience to choose which situation they resonate with most. Audience members will then join 1 of 4 groups to discuss their personal situations, their solutions or possible solutions then elect the top 3 solutions to brief the rest of the other groups. \r\n4) Two vital techniques in big band drumming are then discussed: “Distinguishing signal from noise” knowing the current location of the chart without listening to anyone’s sense of time, and “Some of your great ideas may not be so great.” The audience will then be asked to verbalize their own parallels, and If the interest and energy are present, we can briefly split into two groups, discuss and brief.\r\n5) The “Kubis” chart is then projected on the screen and actually played on the drum set asking the audience to try and observe, as best they can, all that is going on with the drum set performance. We then deconstruct each element of successful drum chart execution. Each element and a lesson to take away:\r\na) Element- Initiating and maintaining a tempo for the band. Lesson- What is least exciting for you may be most important to them.  You set the tone for what is to come and instill a sense of calm. Sometimes you’re just a piece of leverage. Wow that last one hurt.\r\nb) Element- Identify milestones. Lesson- Marking points in time to celebrate progress, ensure social/technical alignment, and instill confidence.\r\nc) Element- Vary intensity as needed. Lesson- Selectively applying energy at the right times and in the right places, balancing support, teaching, and inspiration.\r\nd) Element- Special care. Lesson- Sometimes hand-holding is necessary.\r\ne) Element- Set them up for success. Lesson- Anytime you set someone up for success, they feel good and want to work with you. \r\nThe audience is once again, asked to choose which of these they resonate with most. Audience members will then join 1 of 5 groups and discuss their personal situations (or parallels) amongst their group. Each group will then brief the other groups. \r\n6) The “Clapping at Camp” chart is introduced. I show how without even being able to read music (or a rhythm chart) I can still set them up for success. We rehearse the sections of the chart. Then we perform the chart together and they clap in time like they were born to do it. It’s really fun.\r\n\r\nPresentation History\r\nThis topic has been presented at Agile West, Las Vegas, 2016. \r\nSummary score of 8.69. Total attendees 45. Total of 4 written comments here verbatim:\r\n1- Fun! Fun! Fun! Perspective and musical metaphor\r\n2- Novel application and most engaging session by far! \r\n3- Very unique, engaging, and appropriate. One of my favorite presentations and many parallels were illustrated.\r\n4- Content was delivered in a muddled way. Good points were buried in musician stories and metaphors.\r\n\r\nReferences to Speaking Ability\r\nI like to pull people out of their everyday situations, immerse them into something completely different that is fun and interesting, then help them to draw parallels back to their everyday situations. This is an efficient path to a fresh perspective, which is the most valuable take-away from any conference.  \r\nThe ideal reaction cycle I strive for is: a) I wonder what that would be like, b) cool I didn’t know that, c) whoa I need to try this out. \r\nI have spoken at Agile West, CMMI Institute Conferences, Pacific Norhwest Software Quality Conference, National Defense Industrial Association. I have also delivered good and bad news to leaders of many corporations. \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\nKerry Trujillo,  Kerry_Trujillo@raytheon.com, see linkedIn recommendation\r\nMichael West, michael@naturalspi.com\r\n","abstract":"How does the architect ensure a great product, in spite of, well, the situation at hand?

I’m curious if any parallels to architect or architecture surfaced during your presentation at that venue. This proposal fits Topic 3, “The software architect’s role in leading teams and influencing business decisions” in the call for presentations. There are different ways to approach this, with perspectives on people, process, or product. It is not necessary to cover all perspectives though I’d like to better understand where you will probe for parallels. Do you think the product (software architecture) will be a point of discussion or will it be more about stories of people and process?\r\n\r\nYour notes provide a good sense of the topics covered and the flow through the session. A little more information about timing within the 90 minutes would be helpful. The breakdown into element and lesson gives a sense of the parallels between drummer and leadership (in general).

The group participation discussed in steps 3, 5, and possibly step 4, in the SATURN proposal are an addition to this version of the talk. These group exercises will allow for a richer processing experience for the folks than what happened at AW. All this added up gives me about 35 minutes for 2 or 3 group participation exercises which should be no problem. This is general time estimate, if specific time allocations are required I would be happy to add them.  Additionally, in this limited time, at AW no parallels to architect came up at AW.\r\n\r\nAs for being under topic 3, I am happy to go with that. People, process, or product- the parallels will focus mostly on people. People are the common point between BB drumming and architects. But to be honest with you, I am not sure where these group exercises will go. One of the verbal comments after my talk at AW was that I did not presuppose to know the parallels exactly, and left space for attendees to formulate their own. It is the opening of this space that is my objective, less so giving a direct answer.   \r\n\r\nFrom you- The breakdown into element and lesson gives a sense of the parallels between drummer and leadership (in general). Would you say more about the points you will make about how these relate more specifically to the architect’s “situation”. \r\n\r\nResponse- From the 5000 foot perspective, the BB Drummer and architect have the same challenge. Take responsibility for the vision and integrity of the product without being given any authority or owning any of the resources. From lower altitude I am happy to make some adjustments though I do worry about anchoring, or disrupting where participants can go with their parallels. How do you feel about the “additions” below?\r\n\r\n5a) Element- Initiating and maintaining a tempo for the band. Lesson- What is least exciting for you may be most important to them.  You set the tone for what is to come and instill a sense of calm. Sometimes you’re just a piece of leverage. Wow that last one hurt. Addition- While trying to balance creativity, risk, stakeholders and the responsibility to change the world, it is good to have a basic rhythm that all can operate to. \r\n\r\n5b) Element- Identify milestones. Lesson- Marking points in time to celebrate progress, ensure social/technical alignment, and instill confidence. Addition-  Is there a build and release rhythm you can work to?\r\n\r\n5c) Element- Vary intensity as needed. Lesson- Selectively applying energy at the right times and in the right places, balancing support, teaching, and inspiration. Addition- The creative process comes down to a give and take in real time. You must dabble in interactions with people in the “known” before you can step over to the “unknown.”\r\n\r\n5d) Element- Special care. Lesson- Sometimes hand-holding is necessary. Addition- Sometimes you don’t have to blow up the village in order to save it. Education and patience can pay off. \r\n\r\n5e) Element- Set them up for success. Lesson- Anytime you set someone up for success, they feel good and want to work with you. Addition- Introduce people to the patterns that you see with grace and composure to assure overall success. \r\n\r\nBest- John \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T01:50:50.787Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T01:50:50.787Z"}]},{"id":7179,"state":"submitted","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2016-12-15T21:54:56.213Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T17:42:03.113Z","additional_info":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-RBaNTGJSk&list=PLvk9Yh_MWYuwTYjxOqjzOlVmFFHvN3Yp7&index=1&t=3s","rating":100.0,"trust":85.7142857142857,"tag_list":["30-min tech talk","pipelines","jenkins","continuous delivery","cd","ci","continuous integration","automation","docker","containers"],"profile":{"name":"Avantika Mathur","bio":"Avan is a Global Technical Account Manager at Electric Cloud.

While the DEMO part of the talk shows a Java web application deployed using Docker, the platform itself does support any deployment target- be it mainframe, embedded devices, hardware, mobile, etc., and can plug-in any point tool (including unique tools used by Chip/automotive manufacturers, etc.) and technology stack.\r\n\r\nGed - do these updates answer any of your questions as well?\r\n\r\nLet me know if this helps. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nAvan\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-03T23:43:10.482Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T23:43:10.482Z"},{"id":3036,"submission_id":7179,"talk_id":13725,"user":{"name":"Ged Byrne","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef4de37718ebb5c4fc1c2236331ee9d9?s=500","email":"ged.byrne@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Avan,\r\n\r\nThank-you for your response.  The updates do help to answer my questions, but it does leave me with a couple of concerns.\r\n\r\nThe first is still regarding the the claim: \"Deploy any application to any environment using any tool-set – for free.\" \r\n\r\nWhen you say \"free\" do you mean free of licensing cost, or free of the cost of \"the operational and technology overhead.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim that it is free of licencing cost is valid, with a few caveats.  The tools being integrated are free of charge and Electric Cloud can be free for up to 10 community hosts.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not so sure about the claim regarding overhead costs.  As you say earlier in the submission: \"the operational and technology overhead of orchestrating the hand-offs from one tool to the next in the process are not without cost.\"  The later claim that you\r\n\r\nDoes electric cloud eliminate costs for ANY tool, or only the tools for which a plug-in already exists?   What about tools that do not have an existing plug-in?  \r\n\r\nMy second concern is that the presentation feels like product demonstration.  It appears to introduce the problem of overhead costs for automation and orchestration and then present Electric Cloud as the solution to that problem.\r\n\r\nThe audience of Architects would like to go deeper than that.  They would be interested in seeing how Electric Cloud is solving this problem.  What are the underlying patterns and principles adopted by Electric Cloud in order to reduce the total cost of ownership for software delivery pipelines?\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\n\r\nGed","created_at":"2017-01-04T08:44:18.442Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T08:44:18.442Z"},{"id":3097,"submission_id":7179,"talk_id":13725,"user":{"name":"Avantika Mathur","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7991eeae861b2945ebb8ebaca2f54d2e?s=500","email":"oheel@catapultpr-ir.com"},"body":"Hi Ged -\r\n\r\nHopefully these help answer some of your questions: \r\n\r\n1.

Know the difference between Newtonian-style abstractions and Aristotelian-style abstractions. Aristotelian abstractions are built up piecemeal and are full of corner cases, like Aristotelian physics. Newtonian abstractions are elegant, formal, and composable.\r\n\r\n2. Follow a design process for developing an algebraic abstraction that can compose and easily express solutions (Newtonian style). Building data transformation pipelines is the step most people who are learning functional programming get to from reading and experimenting. Building algebraic abstractions is the next step, but there isn't much literature on the topic (outside of academia)\r\n    1. Elaborate a physical metaphor\r\n    2. Describe the meaning of your metaphor as mathematical statements\r\n    3. Construct the meaning using constructs from the language\r\n    4. Implement the abstraction by refactoring the meaning\r\n\t\r\n\tThe physical metaphor is an important first step that gives us an anchor from which we may use our intuition. We then query our metaphor for its properties and write them in math, which usually means types and equations. After that, we can construct a runnable version of the meaning, being careful to build it out of parts constrained by our statements from step 2. Finally, the implementation becomes an easy matter of refactoring our runnable version.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis topic idea comes from my experience teaching functional programming to people with all levels of experience. There seems to be a logical progression of insights that people go through as they learn about functional programming. I don't see many people getting past the \"data transformation\" step, so I want to present something further. It's hard to say whether it's THE next step, but it is at least one step beyond transformations.\r\n\r\nA lot of the thinking comes from my experience as a professional Clojure and Haskell programmer and the work of Conal Elliott, John Hughes, and Gerald Sussman.\r\n\r\nI have given a version of this talk at Clojure/conj 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJIUoaIvD20 I would love to adapt this to a language like JavaScript.

Scale is unclear - is this more of a programming-in-the-large or small approach or is it applicable at all scales? Is there evidence that the resulting abstractions are robust in practice?

If the recognition wasn't done right, then poor input can be processed and lead to exploits. \r\nLanguage-theoretic security suggests, that the recognition be separated from the processing making it easier to audit the code, and fundamentally prevent parser bugs from recurring. \r\nIn this talk, I would present an overview of Language-theoretic security and describe the parser combinator library hammer.

Please find more information you have asked for below.\r\n\r\nWhat is your definition of chaos engineering?\r\n\r\nIn our definition, Chaos Engineering is a discipline where we will simulate real world failures which occur rarely and cause catastrophic losses to the systems. This is much more important in cloud environments where we have completely relinquished the infrastructure management and high level service management to the cloud provider. Traditional testing mechanisms do not cover such self inflicted failures. Using Chaos Engineering tools, applications can subject themselves to failures and measure their resiliency.\r\n\r\nHow do you commonly work with teams to improve their microservices?\r\n\r\nAs part of integration and performance testing of applications, we engage them and set them up with cloud detour, the chaos engineering tool. The application teams can then start registering various failures against the application and infrastructure. For example random termination of servers and high CPU simulation affecting the processes. This will help evaluate how the microservice performed against the failures and if it still met the NFRs.\r\n\r\nhow generally applicable the solution you use at Capital One is or whether it is highly specific to your needs\r\n\r\nThe solution is very generic for applications deployed in AWS. Any AWS deployed application will be able to use the various aspects of solution whether the application just uses Infrastructure services like EC2 or higher level application services like ECS/S3\r\n\r\nAdditional information on AWS and general availability\r\n\r\nThe tool received a great feedback in its initial pilot and currently being aggressively adopted by various divisions. Over next few months, we will be able to make it Open Source ready for the community use. Also one of our objectives is to build an abstraction layer over the capabilities and make it available in other cloud providers like Azure and Google cloud. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSathiya \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-22T03:04:34.247Z","updated_at":"2017-01-22T03:04:34.247Z"}]},{"id":7896,"state":"submitted","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2017-01-11T15:01:30.322Z","updated_at":"2017-01-12T21:45:31.754Z","additional_info":"https://www.infoq.com/presentations/server-nashorn-spring\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISKA10JQOuo\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36g1aoVvyrY","rating":50.0,"trust":14.2857142857143,"tag_list":["infrastructure as code","infrastructure automation","agile","cloud native","iaas","paas","cloud"],"profile":{"name":"Topher Bullock","bio":"Topher is a senior software engineer at Pivotal and is based out of the Toronto, Canada office.

From small devices to houses, the IoT is leading more and more things into the digital fold every day.  Sensors are necessary to turn billions of objects into data-generating “things” that can report on their status, and in some cases, interact with their environment.  At the moment, cities are at a crossroads where they must choose to either use or lose the transformative potential of big data. Advances in AI and the widespread availability of sensors have provided us with powerful applications that allow us to perform daily tasks by analyzing the huge amount of data.  The insights to be gained from data are endless.  In the light of this a new paradigm of combining AI and IoT has emerged, in which the quality of life could be increased through the use of big data and cloud technology.

A connector is a self-contained, physical (i.e. binary), identifiable special-purpose component that isolates interfaces from communicating components. This way interfaces contained in connectors become pivotal architectural elements.\r\n\r\nThrough interfaces in connectors, components can be supplied with extra-functional services, such as the monitoring and budgeting of system-resource usage, the profiling of architecturally relevant components, and the checking of communication protocols. These services are beneficial for industrial systems that are maintained and evolve in the field. Connectors are a means of realizing blue/green deployments, canary releases, and performance monitors; all of which are necessary for DevOps scenarios that work in industrial environments. Connectors take over these tasks. Components can focus on their core businesses.\r\n\r\nEven without any extra-functional services, connectors provide two significant advantages to the development and operation of resource-constrained, safety-critical embedded systems. Firstly, connectors physically decouple communicating components, in the sense that components depend on connectors but connectors do not depend on components. Secondly, connectors do not need heavyweight component frameworks for implementation. \r\n\r\nConnectors can be built for and operated in rich runtime environments such as .NET CLR, and in thin runtime environments such as crt0 for the C++ system. The basic system need only support state-of-the art interface-based programming and linkable compiling units. To build connectors of different kinds, we use several techniques and design patterns of different pattern languages in different combinations, for example Factory, Strategy and Decorator from E. Gamma et al., Registry from M. Fowler, Bounded Context from E. Evans and Insulation from J. Lakos.\r\n\r\nThe presentation is divided into three parts. In the first part we introduce the minimal connector and explain the consequences and benefits for developing, testing and configuring component systems. In the second part we develop the minimal connector into light connectors containing plain interfaces (call and callback) and then into heavy connectors with additional extra-functional services. In the third part we apply connectors for structuring a system whose development follows the DevOps methodology.","notes":"","abstract":"Physically independent connectors decouple components without performance costs.

The first paragraph is the short answer and the next two paragraphs are background and explanation.  Your interest is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThe model at CRA uses standards we developed for first data model for data collection which is bounded context.  In the ESRI data model we leveraged the Subtype and domains, where different subtypes drive the domains.  When we morphed the model into the ESRI standard electric utility model, the same holds true as the model is denormalized by mapping feature(i.e. transformer has a transformer layer rather than being one point feature in the point layer).\r\n\r\nThe modeling we applied has a time element.  There is a data collection stage of most any project which will require data to be normalized to geometry (points, lines and polygons representing features as electrical apparatus in the real world).  After this phase there is an information modeling aspect that requires use of standards to apply various third party tools and integrations.  The integrations vary depending on what solutions need to be integrated.  As budgets and priorities come into play the priorities are often different between power utilities.  However, Power utilities require Network Analysis and Power Outage Management Systems to maintain high systems availability.  The return on investment is staggering to implement the outage management and network analysis systems.  In addition the mapping must always tie to Work Management Systems.\r\n\r\nDepending on the Utility size, microservices are typically used, however, there may need to be some cost saving, less expensive integrations such as ETL to move data into another format (i.e. daily job).  This is what happened with CRA and happens with most Power Utilities (even most very large ones).  There is a second reason for the reason web services cannot always be used – much of it has to do with the industry needs a network model that has sufficient performance.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-09T13:43:04.671Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T13:43:04.671Z"},{"id":3157,"submission_id":7667,"talk_id":14587,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nThanks for your submission!

Since then we've gone from shipping our monolith with very our fingers crossed to shipping every day with confidence. We'll look at how we changed our development practices, improved what and how we test, and automated our workflows. We'll also examine some of the unique enterprise concerns around continuous delivery and how we adapted and evolved our process so our engineering team works in tandem with design, and product to ship as often as possible.\r\n\r\nIntended Audience: Developers, DevOps people who are working on complicated/large scale applications and haven't been able to recognize the benefits of continuous delivery.

Architecture validations are becoming part of the processes used by IT groups to ensure software quality, and architecture review knowledge, reference materials and trained resources are becoming increasingly available. \r\nContinuous customer feedback is the best way to validate a software product and indirectly its architecture. Unfortunately, the system needs to be fully delivered in order to get that valuable feedback, and the cost of adjusting a software architecture after the system has been delivered is usually very high. The objective of the architecture validation techniques we describe in this presentation is to ensure that the future system meets its business objectives and quality attribute requirements, without slowing down the pace of delivery associated with Continuous Delivery.\r\nArchitecture validations deal with far more than just the technical issues, since business drivers are a key force in shaping an architecture. One of the key benefits of continuous architecture validations is that they periodically review the relations between business goals and architecture. As a result, they ensure that the system is designed, built and delivered in a way that provides the greatest benefit for its stakeholders.\r\nThis presentation describes how our approach can be leveraged to validate architectures in any type of project, and especially in a Continuous Delivery project.  First we define what we mean by Architecture Validation. Then we focus  on when to conduct Architecture Validations. We then discuss the roles required in an Architecture Validation. We finally detail how we can conduct architecture validations by describing some industry recognized techniques such as questionnaire-driven approaches, scenario-based approaches (including SEI's ATAM) and decision-based approaches (such as DCAM).\r\nIn order to illustrate the concepts introduced in this presentation, we will use a real-life example of Continuous Architecture Validation, showing how various approaches can be combined to effectively validate a project.","notes":"Murat Erder (Deutsche Bank, London) will be a co-presenter. This presentation builds upon our presentation on Continuous Architecture at SATURN 2016, and is the result of significant research and practical and extensive experience in this field. Further details can be found in our \"Continuous Architecture\" book (Morgan Kaufman, Nov 2015), and especially in Chapter 6 of that book.\r\n     \r\nThe tentative outline of the presentation would be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction: Why do we need to continuously validate the architecture? ***Note: this section will introduce a case study which will be used throughout the presentation to illustrate the concepts \r\n \r\n2. What do we mean by ‘Architecture Validation’?***Note: this section will introduce the concept of Continuous Customer Feedback\r\n\r\n3. When do we need to validate the architecture?\r\n\r\n4.

Summary & Recommendations\r\n","abstract":"As the pace of innovation increases, IT groups are using agile approaches & short release cycles to deliver systems rapidly.

Adapting to Continuous Delivery is a problem that I am personally dealing with and performing Continuous Architectural Validation looks like a useful approach.\r\n\r\nI do have a couple of questions that I would like to ask.\r\n\r\nFirstly, you make the following assertion : \"Of course, the Continuous Customer Feedback Loop is the best architecture validation process.\"  \r\n\r\nI understand that this term is widely used in industry, but it may be new to many Architects.  Is knowledge and acceptance of the Continuous Customer Feedback Loop required by audience members or will you explain the concept and the reasons for adopting it? \r\n\r\nSecondly, you say that at the session will end as follows:  \"Finally we give a real life example of Continuous Architecture Evaluation in practice, showing how various approaches can be combined to effectively validate a project.\"  \r\n\r\nIs it possible to introduce the real life example earlier in the presentation?  Personally I have always found it easier to understand new concepts when they are introduced in a practical real life context.

Yes, the process here is we'll share some feedback you can use to update your submission or clarify with the tech committee, then next week we'll look at all the submissions and finalize the program taking into account the strength of the proposals but also make sure we have a good breadth and depth of relevant topics.\r\n\r\nHere are a few thoughts for your consideration.  This looks like good technical content and a nice, tight focus, but I worry that the primary SATURN audience will find this too low level.  If you are able to make a clearer connection from C++ corner cases and language \"oddities\" to broad systemic properties such as maintainability, performance, testability, etc. then I think the proposed talk could be a better fit for the audience.\r\n\r\nWe certainly cover technology and programming languages at SATURN, but the emphasis is on architectural design.  Perusing some past presentations might give you a better feel for the types of topics and level of detail https://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2016/\r\n\r\nThis proposal could also be made stronger by providing a bit more detail, especially for a 90 minute talk.

If you create an architecture that doesn’t give value to the customer you are wasting your time. When I talk to customers I often hear horror stories about how their current systems were developed by someone in an ivory tower who didn’t understand them or their work. So how do you make sure that you are bringing value to the customer through your architecture? Use customer centric design processes often called Contextual Design or Design Thinking. These are fundamental parts of Lean and Agile and this session shows how to use them in architecture with hands on experience. In this highly interactive session participants redesign a system by interviewing a customer, creating a prototype, reviewing it with the group, and getting feedback on their design. Using the methods taught in this class you can create value for your customer through your architecture and become their hero, or at least not the person in the ivory tower who is ruining their life.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nParticipants will learn basic methods of contextual design and design thinking and how they apply to the architecture of a software system\r\nParticipants will learn customer interviewing techniques to gain knowledge of the customer's functional and non-functional requirements\r\nParticipants will learn creating prototypes of their architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to give constructive feedback on an architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to receive constructive feedback on an architecture","notes":"My goal for this session is to help architects learn a customer centric design process. I learned this method from the \"Deciding what to Design\" course at Carnegie Mellon. The method is often called Contextual Design or Design Thinking. Its a fundamental part of Lean and Agile. I've rarely seen people show how these methodologies apply to architecture, so thats my goal for class.\r\n\r\nI use this process in my own work at GE and previously at Verizon.  I lead the End to End Customer Experience efforts at Verizon and enabled our architects and software engineers to talk to customers. I gave a talk on that experience at a past SATURN that generated a lot of interest.\r\n\r\nAt GE I am using this method to design a new CI/CD system for our Industrial Internet of Things platform called Predix. Customers (anyone who gets value from the system you are creating) really appreciate working with me. I find out very surprising things by using this method and create much better systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nA slightly modified version of this session has been given before at Code on The Beach and was well received.  I used the \"App for adding contact to network\" use case and it ended up being a common but complex enough task that the groups had plenty to design. The Code on the Beach session was 60 minutes long and I assigned roles to each team member. I didn’t have time to have feedback given to each group, but I think it is an effective way to leverage the knowledge in the room. I didn’t have time to fit in the last wrap up session either, which I think is critical for people to concrete the new information. I've added those two parts to this 90 minute session.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nParticipants will learn basic methods of contextual design and design thinking and how they apply to the architecture of a software system\r\nParticipants will learn customer interviewing techniques to gain knowledge of the customer's functional and non-functional requirements\r\nParticipants will learn creating prototypes of their architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to give constructive feedback on an architecture\r\nParticipants will learn how to receive constructive feedback on an architecture\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participatory session will include the following:\r\n15 minutes\r\nIntroduction to Customer Experience Design\r\nIntroduce the hands on Exercise: Design a new system for adding a contact to your network (Linkedin, google+ , etc.)\r\nDivide session into groups of 4 or 5 people.\r\n\r\n10 minutes\r\nActivity 1: Determine what matters to the customer including their functional requirements and quality attributes by watching how they do the task in their natural environment and asking lots of “why’s”. I will ask each group to select someone in their group to be the \"customer.\" Each group will watch their customer collect a business card from a person and add a contact to their network of choice.\r\n\r\n25 minutes \r\nActivity 2: Design the system around the customer’s needs and document it in a prototype. The prototype should be as interactive as possible, not just a flow chart. Prototype should show the architecture elements. Because the “customer” is involved, the team should be constantly getting input from the customer on their on going design. They should also write down any assumptions they are making and any reasons they made design decisions. Finalize the prototype, the assumptions, design decisions, and what they learned from the process.\r\n\r\n30 minutes \r\nActivity 3: Review the prototype with the group. Receive feedback on design. About 5 minutes each group.\r\n\r\n5 minutes\r\nWrap up: Allow the small groups to meet one last time to discuss the feedback and make any changes to their design.\r\n\r\n10 minutes\r\nFinal Group discussion: Discuss what they learned from the session.

While there is some work in this field, most of it has been devoted to metrics and estimates. Metrics are shadows of snowflakes, and thus not particularly informative when seeking to understand the purpose of a system or the behavior of a component. Improving estimation, while an interesting application and a laudable goal, likewise does not directly help developers create better software faster, nor manage the growing complexity of real-world systems. Can we apply ML in ways that help guide development, inform software archaeology, and reduce effort for developers? If so, can these things help us take on the systems-of-systems-of-systems of the future, where million-line code bases will be considered \"quaint\"?\r\nAfter a brief survey of existing/past work in the area, we'll investigate the question of \"what does software look like\", examine the more interesting question of \"what does good software look like\", and use these insights to explore how we can enable developers to create and manage ever-larger software systems.

I am explicitly using domain-driven design structures (bounded contexts, context maps) married with semantic visualizations (topic maps derived from natural language processing word-vector vocabularies) as a yardstick for what \"good\" software looks like .\r\n- yes.

I have applied earlier versions of the tools to real-world projects (e.g. mapping 72,000 stories and 8,000 classes into the same semantic space), and continue to do so.

They often combine building blocks that come from the AWS cloud as well as UPMC data centers. \r\nIn this initiative we leveraged packages provided by several vendors (Amazon, Microsoft, Dell, and others) and open source software such as GitHub, Artifactory, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, etc. ","abstract":"The success of your DevOps team depends on the collaboration between development and operations teams, maturity of development processes, security architecture, guiding architecture principles, and the ability your team to automate the delivery of software and infrastructure to customers.

Users have become familiar with popular web applications, and expect perfect uptime, bug-free experiences, simple and intuitive UI, and perfect security. Fortunately, the proliferation of high-quality frameworks for virtually *everything*—front-end, back-end, infrastructure—has made the job of the developer significantly easier. In this talk, I'll outline how my team used Django and Twitter Bootstrap to build a complete production reporting solution in under three months. These tools are incredibly powerful and can save you hundreds of hours of work.\r\n\r\nWe'll also discuss the trade-offs associated with training, and the impacts of choosing to train your team extensively or more sparsely on the tools you develop. The decision on training turns out to be more nuanced than you would expected.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we'll discuss:\r\n\r\n* Why Django—ORM, Security, Usability, Modularity\r\n* Why Bootstrap—benefits of smooth, consistent, popular UI\r\n* Django admin, CBVs—save time by getting to know the framework\r\n* How to set up the team for success—necessary training, knowledge, etc.\r\n\r\nWe've had great success with these tools, and you can too!","notes":"I've been writing django apps for a number of years now. I've managed three teams writing django applications, which gives me significant insight into what worked and what didn't, as well as what would have made it better; I would love to give that advice over to potential users. \r\n\r\nThe talk should probably be given to either technical managers or developers who understand what a database is and know at least basics of coding.\r\n\r\nThis can be expanded into an interactive tutorial if necessary.

They also believe that Big Requirements Up Front (BRUF) is an Agile anti-pattern.  While BRUF may be a poor strategy for gathering functional requirements, it is the best strategy for identifying quality goals.\r\n\r\nMost functional requirements may eventually emerge because of clearer customer understanding.  Unfortunately, most quality goals will not and those that do are unlikely to emerge early.\r\n\r\nInternal quality goals such as code understandability and testability, will never emerge from domain understanding.  Some high-profile external goals such as safety, security, and privacy may emerge, but at unpredictable times.  Others, such as ease of use, reliability, and responsiveness, will emerge if there are gross quality failures.  A focus on functionality will delay emergence of most quality goals.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, waiting for quality goal emergence is a poor idea and unnecessary.  Waiting results in the accumulation of sizable technical debt during early iterations.  Debt piles up because quality support functions, such as exception handlers, are missing everywhere.\r\n\r\nUse of a comprehensive quality model enables quality goals to be identified early.  It also enables the early specification of both quality achievement and quality verification strategies.  Such a quality model is freely available at www.quality-aware.com/q-a-daves-stuff.php.

REST over HTTP is a popular choice for microservices APIs because it promotes openness, self-discovery, and simplicity.  One alternative to REST is [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/), an implementation of Protobuf.  As an RPC-based API, gRPC inhibits openness and self-discovery but promotes performance and, depending on the implementation, can provide stronger compile-time (or at least call-time) guarantees which help developers avoid mistakes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will share our experiences migrating a REST-based microservice to gRPC, as well as lessons learned implementing gRPC APIs in a suite of backing microservices for the Watson Discovery Service.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, attendees will know\r\n\r\n* What gRPC is and how it is different from REST\r\n* How to organize code to make API transitions easier\r\n* The benefits of functional testing using Cucumber and tips for creating extensible gRPC API tests using Ruby\r\n* How to implement common REST patterns in gRPC\r\n* Common pitfalls for using gRPC in a microservices architecture and some solutions","notes":"This talk will have the following tentative outline.\r\n\r\n1.

Our architecture pattern languages have changed as have our development, deployment, and operating procedures (DevOps).  \r\n\r\nDuring this transition, one source of ideas has been the functional programming community.  Functional programming itself mostly happens within a module and indeed many software architects treat it as an implementation choice, unrelated to architecture.  But it turns out that some ideas from the FP community are helpful in architectural design: statelessness, immutability, and pure functions.  They underlie DevOps practices and are at the core of many distributed systems patterns at the core of our architectures.\r\n\r\n## Why now?  \r\nFunctional programming ideas have been around for a long time but conditions are ripe.\r\n\r\n1.  Coping strategy for complexity.  As systems get bigger but our brains stay the same size, we invent tech to cope.  Statelessness, immutability, and pure functions make it easier to reason about how a system behaves.\r\n2.  Problems grew in size.  No single computer big enough to run a system.  FP ideas suited to parallelism and concurrency, so many smaller computers can solve big problems.\r\n3.  We have more money than sense.  You can buy 100 cloud machines for less than one junior developer.  So why not do Continuous Integration with every source code commit?  Why not have a farm of servers running different versions of your code during deployments?  Why not burn RAM with immutable data structures?\r\n\r\n## Functional ideas in modern architectures\r\n\r\n1. Client-side.  Reactive patterns and frameworks.  Eg React, CycleJS, Elm.\r\n2. Server-side.  So-called \"serverless\" pure functions.  REST architectural style.  Reactive services.  Event queues between services.\r\n3. Persistence.  Append-only datastores.  Event sourcing & Command Query Response Segregation (CQRS).\r\n4. Batch sequential & pipeline architectures:  Big data processing (Hadoop, Spark), Map-Reduce, Tensorflow and other machine learning graph-based functional transformation.\r\n5. Devops infrastructure.  Version control everything (append-only).  So-called \"immutable\" and \"idempotent\" infrastructure set up by running code, not by Linux admins.\r\n\r\n## Reactive programming\r\n1. What is it?  Evolution of Observer pattern.  Observable = Observer pattern plus onError and onCompletion.  Hot and cold streams.\r\n2. Use in UI architectures.  Strong competitor to Model-View-Controller and sibling patterns.  \r\n\r\n## What you will learn in this talk\r\nThe amount of innovation and hype in web technologies is intense and often overwhelming.  If you haven't been staying current, this talk should give you a mental map to start your learning.  If you have stayed current, this talk should reveal how functional ideas weave throughout modern web architectures and perhaps provide insight into why they work.\r\n\r\nThe talk surveys how modern web systems are built with FP patterns.  It will dig into one client-side example and show how FP ideas can simplify this task.","notes":"I propose this as a 30-minute tech talk.

If the audience is really new to FP ideas, it can take time to see how to accomplish work using these patterns.  There is a great game we could play a few rounds of ([Cube Composer](http://david-peter.de/cube-composer)) to warm them up (go ahead and try it now).  Then we could design a system using event queues and discuss the quality attribute tradeoffs, or go further into the UI reactive example.","abstract":"Functional programming (FP) has invaded architectures.

The value proposition design book came out in 2014 and to the best of my knowledge it has had limited or only modest coverage at SATURN. The presentation will be based on my experience in applying the concepts on two software products at ASSA ABLOY Scandinavia. The material has not been presented before. \r\n\r\nLearning objectives\u000bAfter the talk the audience should\r\n-  have a basic understanding of the Strategyzer business model and customer value proposition canvases\r\n- understand the relevance of Strategyzers tools to architecture practice for collecting business drivers and requirements\r\n- be able to judge when to apply the Strategyzer tools\r\n\r\nRough outline\r\n\t- Problem statement: turning products into services\r\n\t- Introduction to Strategyzer business model canvas\r\n\t- Introduction to Strategyzer value proposition canvas and design method\r\n\t- Story of how we applied Strategyzer's value proposition design at ASSA ABLOY\r\n\t- Summary of lessons learned\r\n","abstract":"Overcome lengthy backlogs and tight development budgets.

This is not altogether different for how small startups often stumble or fail when they try to transition to the big leagues.  As far as context goes, I think this applies to any web, desktop or mobile system (internal to an organization or used by the public) that is intended to be used by individuals in multiple countries across the globe.  In particular if you are dealing with private or sensitive data.  When I refer to the “global jungle” I am talking about the multitude of things that you often don’t think or worry about when you \"first build\" your solution for your \"first user base\", but can be a catastrophic problem when you try to transition to a new region or the globe (and forces you back to the drawing board or worse yet becomes a fatal flaw and threatens your overall business model).  What do you feel is the best way to clarify the context due to its broad nature? <br><br>\r\nHow Deep? <br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nMy goal in this session is not to attempt to make anyone an expert in any given area.  Instead I want to give them an awakening so that they walk away with a new found appreciation that there are a bunch of other things they should spend some critical time on; since by spending it now it may very well either save their project from an unanticipated problem or differentiate them since their competitors failed to consider them.  Think back to when you first heard the horror stories around security and that had a lasting impact on your belief that it is something that shouldn’t be ignored.  I want to try to do the same for many other aspects that few people take seriously until it’s too late. <br><br>\r\nADVICE/TAILORING? <br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThis listing is what I have cultivated over the years and have used successfully to make both large and small systems “globally ready” and successful for the largest business unit of a 36.8 billion dollar company (for both internet and internal facing solutions).

Modules are design-time units with fixed domains and hidden design decisions. Modules particularly promote systematic correctness analyses. However, these beneficial properties disappear once the modules have been integrated into and deployed on target machines. For embedded systems that run within tight real-time constraints, modules may even hamper integration tests and fault analyses, due to the inaccessibility of modules' internals. Hence, for an HW/SW-integration platform of an X-by-wire eCar, we developed HDCs in order to non-intrusively trace and test the behavior of single and multiple modules (HDCs) integrated into one or more platform nodes.\r\n\r\nHDCs transfer modules from design-time entities to runtime entities. HDCs can be tested in integrated systems during field operation, without code instrumentation and probing effects. For this purpose, the HDC runtime environment captures data structures that flow within and between HDCs for one macro cycle (e.g. lasting 10 ms) of the time-triggered system; each macro cycle anew. An HDC can access only internal and parametric data structures. The probe is the only HDC with full access to all data structures, including its own. Because they are half-open for the probe and half-closed for all other HDCs, we call these data capsules hemispheric.\r\n\r\nIn the presentation, we will first reveal requirements behind HDCs originating from an industry study on an HW/SW-integration platform providing safety services to a fail-operational eCar (www.projekt-race.de/en). We will then sketch tests that can be run for HDCs. This motivates the design and implementation of general HDCs and the probe, which we will describe afterwards. We will critically reflect on our experiences with HDCs during development, in the lab and in the field, and present further ideas related to HDCs and beneficial to a HDC system as a basis for discussion.","notes":"","abstract":"A Hemispheric Data Capsule (HDC) is a runtime entity of a module with externalized data structures.

This is different from the well-known [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) (Implemented for C++ in [[1]](https://github.com/actor-framework) and [[2]](http://www.theron-library.com/index.php)), which uses private state and peer-to-peer messaging, and is closer in spirit to the [Flux application architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview.html#content) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), with its single dispatcher and its unidirectional data flow.\r\n\r\nOur data model is suitable for high performance and complicated algorithmic flows, where multiple threads require access to shared objects. We have implemented it in C++, and used it successfully as the application framework for the [iTero intra-oral Scanner](http://www.itero.com/en) (See demos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_kYPyjUtbU) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWuNPt33tho))\r\n\r\n###Our architecture is based on the following principles:\r\n\r\n1. All shared state is immutable and reference-counted\r\n1. Each actor keeps a lightweight snapshot of the state, which consists of references to shared immutable objects\r\n1. Actor snapshots are eventually consistent\r\n1. Actors communicate using [Publish-Subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)\r\n1. A single dispatch function is used for publishing both events and data updates\r\n1. Persistence, replay, undo and application logging are handled by generic mechanisms\r\n1. Objects can be marked as *invalidated*, allowing immediate, out-of-band signaling and cancellation of long-running computations","notes":"##Primary track\r\n\r\nI propose this talk for the track **\"Development Tools, Frameworks, Techniques, and Patterns\"**, because it introduces a new framework while referring to existing frameworks and patterns - the Actors model, Flux and Redux. The talk will be highly technical, with diagrams, code and a demonstration video. \r\n\r\n##Session type\r\n\r\nThis talk falls in the category of **\"Technical Talks and Tutorials\"** or **\"Experience Report Presentation\"** (30 minutes), because it is a highly technical presentation, based on my own experience and knowledge. The architecture framework I shall describe in the talk is one that I pioneered and developed, and it forms the basis for the application that drives the [iTero Element](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdI5Pp2dVTg), a leading 3D intra-oral scanner for dentistry and orthodontics. The iTero software was developed under my technical leadership, as a chief architect and lead of the algorithms group. \r\n\r\n\r\n##About me\r\n\r\nI have a Ph.D. in mathematics, and plenty of experience giving lectures.

After 15 years of leading algorithms teams, I decided 4 years ago to become a software architect. Since then, I got a Software Architecture Professional Certification from SEI, and I have been constantly studying and teaching various domains of software engineering.\r\n\r\nI am highly passionate about software architecture, and I love teaching software engineering and mentoring developers, as well as coding in multiple programming languages.

Present the challenge we faced\r\n  - Show video and give a description of the [iTero intra-oral Scanner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdI5Pp2dVTg)\r\n  - Explain the data model we use in earlier versions of iTero, and why it was inadequate for the new product\r\n 1. Present the basics of the architecture\r\n  - Define an \"Actor\"\r\n  - Explain how actors access data and communicate via a dispatcher: All of the shared state is made of immutable data, and any modification is done by creating a new object, and broadcasting it\r\n  - Explain the data model (each actor keeps a key-value dictionary, where the key-space is shared, and the values are pointers to reference-counted objects in the heap)\r\n  - Explain about publish-subscribe and event handlers\r\n 1. Explain how this architecture is different from the famous Actors Model\r\n  - Provide links to existing implementations [1](https://github.com/actor-framework), [2](http://www.theron-library.com/index.php).\r\n  - Explain how our model is based on shared state and publish-subscribe, while the Actors model is using private state and peer-to-peer messaging.\r\n 1. Discuss more aspects of the architecture\r\n  - Separation of concerns: Actors are responsible for message-passing and fetching data from the shared state, and they delegate computations to other objects that are tested in isolation\r\n  - How an actor is created: the role of the dispatcher in making sure that a newly created actor has access to the most up-to-date state\r\n  - A generic solution for persistence\r\n  - Cancellation of long-running operations\r\n  - Generic logging\r\n  - A generic Record/Replay feature\r\n 1. Discuss design trade-offs, and pros & cons of the architecture\r\n  - Pros: Safe concurrency, and ease of implementing complex logic\r\n  - Cons: Data model is flattened into a key-value dictionary, losing a natural hierarchy\r\n 1. Shortly discuss a possible improvement of the data model\r\n  - Use a persistent tree structure (as in [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)), instead of a flat key-value store, to restore the natural hierarchy of objects.","abstract":"We present a battle-proven architecture for lock-free concurrency control in multi-threaded C++ applications.

An architect needs to form collaborations with different teams, often with different styles of working and planning, in order to clarify the project's scope and requirements, and then design the architecture and implement it.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, an architect needs to use all communication tools effectively: Meetings, architecture drawings, written documentation, design reviews, code reviews and informal conversations. In every opportunity, an architect should encourage the engagement of other stakeholders and must learn how to deal effectively with their concerns, and, in particular, how to deal with opposition and with conflict.\r\n\r\nBut communication techniques and technical excellence combined are not sufficient for sustainable effective leadership.

For example: When talking about effective online meetings, I share how useful it is to reflect people's concerns in writing and in real-time, as a way to verify that their concerns are understood correctly, and to give them the feeling that they have been heard; When naming components, I recommend to include others in choosing their names, as a way to encourage their collaboration; For dealing with opposition, I recommend to focus on a better understanding of the opposing party; On dealing with difficulties, I emphasize that this is the time to make extra efforts and display personal integrity, by being there for the developers, and by admitting and correcting one's own mistakes.\r\n\r\nWhile those messages are all relevant to any leadership situation, I believe they are especially useful for software architects, whose effectiveness relies upon their ability to form a collaboration, often without the benefit of a position of authority.\r\n\r\n##Talk outline\r\n\r\nThe talk will be filled with personal stories and examples from my own experience. The audience will be given a set of techniques that anyone can implement and principles that anyone can follow.\r\n\r\n1. Challenges facing a software architect (based on my own experience):\r\n  * Remote teams\r\n  * Some teams not communicating well with one another\r\n  * Teams not used to working with a designated software architect\r\n  * Stakeholders from very different time zones\r\n  * Different cultures of different teams; different levels of agility\r\n  * Poorly documented legacy systems that need to evolve\r\n  * Different opinions about whether to build or to buy\r\n  * Unclear project scope\r\n  * Unclear requirements\r\n  * Stakeholders with prior commitments, who don’t have time to spend on your project\r\n  * Tasks that require designing a kind of system that you have never designed before\r\n1. How to recognize that you have influence?\r\n  * Your designs come to life\r\n  * People ask for your advice on various projects outside your area of responsibility\r\n  * People want you to help them resolve disagreements\r\n  * People tend to accept what you propose\r\n  * People are copying your documentation style\r\n  * People welcome your participation in meetings on any topic\r\n1. Effective meetings (especially remote meetings)\r\n  * Different kinds of meetings require smaller or larger groups\r\n  * Declare the goal of a meeting\r\n  * Publish agenda and slides up-front\r\n  * Phrase questions to be answered during the meeting\r\n  * Capture people's comments and opinions in writing and display in real-time them during the meeting\r\n  * Finish in time, and share meeting notes with people\r\n1. Effective architecture views to bring out the essence of an architecture\r\n  * Depending on the audience, it is often better to present a simple and concise drawing, as opposed to complete sets of architecture views\r\n  * Define names of components/modules/classes and their responsibilities. The other things follow from that. \r\n  * Naming something is an act of leadership. Declaring the name that someone else chose is even stronger. \r\n1. Use written documentation - this is especially important in a big and global organization\r\n  * Writing is hard for people, so there’s an opportunity to stand out here\r\n  * Make information accessible\r\n  * Become the source of information by summarizing it better than others do\r\n1. Encourage the engagement of others\r\n  * Seek the subject matter experts and do 1:1 discussions with them\r\n  * Look for opportunities to incorporate the ideas of others. If you accept someone’s idea, they will be more understanding next time you reject one of their ideas. \r\n  * Look for opportunities to show honest appreciation to other people’s contribution\r\n1. Dealing with opposition, rejections and unknowns\r\n  * If someone opposes an idea, ask questions about it - don’t just insist - regardless of how strongly you feel about your solution\r\n  * Never get attached to a design. Recognize that there are multiple solutions and analyze both the benefits and the cost of any design decision\r\n  * Seek first to understand, and only then to be understood \r\n  * When it is not clear how to make progress, phrase specific questions to be answered and ask for people's help\r\n1. Build personal relationships with stakeholders\r\n  * Get to know people on a personal level\r\n  * Seek opportunities to show your appreciation\r\n1. Be there for developers, after handing off the design to them\r\n  * There will be unanswered questions and difficulties\r\n  * Be there in weekly meetings and sprint planning\r\n  * Notice the conversations between teams, and help where it's needed\r\n1. References to literature\r\n  * [5 levels of leadership by John C Maxwell](https://www.amazon.com/Levels-Leadership-Proven-Maximize-Potential/dp/B005SA65DI)\r\n  * [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People)\r\n  * [How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People)\r\n  * [Benjamin Franklin's autobiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_Benjamin_Franklin)","abstract":"The success of a software architect relies on his/her ability to influence development teams and decision makers and to gain trust with other stakeholders.

If you need to shorten the presentation, I suggest dropping or shortening topics 1, 3, and 8. \r\n\r\nThis sentence is not OK to me: \"Depending on the audience, it is often better to present a simple and concise drawing, as opposed to complete sets of architecture views.\"  Here's how I think (based on \"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition\"): \r\n- a software architecture is described as a set of architecture views. There isn't a single diagram that shows everything.\r\n- you should only create an architecture view if it has clear value to stakeholders (the audience for the software architecture).\r\n- a given architecture view may consist of a simple and concise drawing. \r\n\r\nThe following sentence is not clear to me: \"Declaring the name that someone else chose is even stronger.\"\r\n\r\nIn the talk outline, item (4) recommends: \"Define names of components/modules/classes and their responsibilities. The other things follow from that.\"\r\nI think having expressive names for software elements is important, but that recommendation alone is not very helpful. In fact, item (4) is about effective architecture views and there are so many important recommendations under this topic, such as:\r\n- Use a notation key in your diagrams (or indicate what standard notation you're using).\r\n- Use different symbols for different types of elements and relations. \r\n- Use consistent symbology across diagrams. \r\n- If you're using a pattern in your design, name it. If the reader is familiar with the pattern, he/she will understand the design more easily.\r\n- Use a template (standard organization) for your documentation. In particular, use the same template for all architecture views. (Subsections in a template may be N/A of course.)\r\n- Keep the information up-to-date. If you can't update the documentation, discard, archive or mark it as out-of-date.\r\n- Complement structural diagrams (e.g., UML class diagram) with behavior diagrams (e.g., UML sequence diagram).\r\n- Record the rationale for important design decisions.\r\n- Avoid ambiguity; write from the reader's point of view; review the documentation. \r\nThese recommendations can be found in the book I mentioned above (\"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition\").\r\n\r\nTypos:\r\n- Notes: \"trust and cooperation of *of* stakeholders\"\r\n- Notes: \"Capture people’s comments *opinions* in writing \"\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-04T18:57:06.728Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T18:57:06.728Z"},{"id":3090,"submission_id":7302,"talk_id":13936,"user":{"name":"Adi Levin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1cc0aaebe6a196f253e61d0454edf59?s=500","email":"adi.4694252@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks for the thorough review, Paulo. I am going to use it to improve the presentation, and I am taking this opportunity to clarify my proposal.\r\n\r\nMy emphasis in this presentation will be on the human relations aspects and how they affect the level of influence of a software architect. \r\n\r\nYour comments about the architectural views are correct, and I should rephrase my intent: All of the architectural views are important for reasoning about a system's structure. I am not presenting a different theory of documenting software architecture, but I am commenting about the way in which I would present those architectural views to different stakeholders. In presentations, we often don't have time to go through all of the views; also, we may do it in a more constrained environment of online remote meetings, so we need to focus on the things that yield the most understanding and buy-in from the stakeholders. \r\n\r\nIn this context, I claim that naming and stating the responsibilities of a component or a module, is of especially high value.  The list of responsibilities is a concise representation of the intent of the designer, which helps stakeholders review the architecture and ask good questions about it (e.g. \"if this component is only responsible for X, then how come it depends on Y\"?).\r\n\r\nOne way to make the most out of architectural discussions is to find opportunities where other people contribute. A very powerful application of this is when we name software elements. By asking someone else: \"How would you name this component?\" and accepting the name that they offer, we make them our partners in the project. Similarly, if someone proposes a modification and we accept it, we gain more of their their cooperation, and it will be wise to give credit to the contributors. \r\n\r\nMy plan is to share other insights of this kind. This complements the more technical aspects of analysis, design and documentation, with wisdom that comes from the realm of leadership, effective communication and personal growth, and I have lots of relevant stories from my personal experience, which I think will be highly beneficial to the audience.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I will need to shorten some of the topics - and I will shorten topics 1 & 3, as your proposed. As for topic #8, this is one I would like to emphasize, because my main point is how personal relationships make a difference.\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\n\r\nAdi.","created_at":"2017-01-05T13:46:42.669Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T13:46:42.669Z"},{"id":3091,"submission_id":7302,"talk_id":13936,"user":{"name":"Adi Levin","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1cc0aaebe6a196f253e61d0454edf59?s=500","email":"adi.4694252@gmail.com"},"body":"Paulo - I also fixed the two typos you indicated.

Thanks for the kind words and for your review.\r\n\r\nHere is my context: I have been leading, and am still leading the technical design of a number of projects:\r\n\r\n1. An application for a 3D intra-oral scanner (http://www.itero.com/en) - there were ~20 developers working on it, divided to 4 teams in two locations (Israel and Moscow). Made of C++, C#, high performance algorithms and 3D graphics, interacting with proprietary hardware and real-time components.\r\n\r\n2. A HIPAA-compliant, scalable and highly available cloud-based storage system distributed in multiple data centers with integrations to ~10 applications. Involves ~6 development teams from 4 locations (East coast, West coast, Israel and Moscow), and other stakeholders from 3 more locations. Made of Java, NoSQL database, public cloud storage, REST API, caching layers, custom replication and workflow management, and a challenging data migration and transition strategy.\r\n\r\n3. A scalable and highly available cloud-based architecture for enhancing web applications by server-side algorithms, with interactive-rate messaging between the web page and the dedicated server-side process. Involves 3 teams from 2 locations + stakeholders from 2 more locations. Made of Java, Websocket, REST, elastic cloud-based cluster, with fully automated deployments.\r\n\r\n4. (Currently in early stages:) A cloud-based service for capturing, storing, displaying and manipulating doctor prescriptions. Emphasizes modifiability. Made of React, Java REST API, and document-oriented DB in the cloud.\r\n\r\nI am also involved in multiple other projects related to identity management & authentication, cloud-based workflow management, storage, data analytics, cluster computations, and others.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nRegarding your main feedback: You're right - my presentation should focus on a few key messages. I think those will be:\r\n\r\n1) Ways to get other people more engaged - this includes effective meetings, especially long-distance on-line conference calls, in which I have plenty of experience and success. For example, I want to demonstrate how I capture and display people's comments in real-time, and how satisfying this is to the participants: They know they are understood, and they know their opinion is heard, even when it is not accepted; Another example is getting people involved in the early stages of giving names to components.\r\n\r\n2) Ways to deal with difficulty and opposition: being open to others' ideas; listening, and truly caring about the concerns of others; not being attached to a specific solution, and being ready to challenge your own ideas; This doesn't mean giving up on good design solutions: It means that you should be willing to explain both the advantages and the trade-offs in the design, not in order to defend it at all cost, but in order to truly search for the best solution, thereby laying the foundation for better collaboration in the future, regardless of whose opinion ends up being accepted.\r\n\r\n3) Building long-term credibility. \"They don't care how much you know until they know how much you care\" - show commitment by being there when things are not clear, by allocating time for review and demo sessions; by providing specific feedback on detailed design decisions; by being there when teams disagree and need someone to resolve the dispute; by showing the appreciation and giving credit generously to others; And by admitting and correcting your design mistakes as soon as those come up.\r\n\r\nI will also give useful references to literature, where people can learn more about influence & leadership.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOn a personal note: I attended Saturn 3 years ago. It was one of the best conferences I have ever attended, and I still remember some of the great presentations (Especially the keynotes by Dianne Marsh and Joe Justice; The course by Robert Wojcik; Scott Hanselman's great talk; And others...). I will be honored and deeply excited to be among this excellent group of speakers.\r\n\r\nThis talk is not finalized yet. I have so many stories and references to share. I am planning to use the reviewers' feedback, and to do my absolute best to make this a great presentation worthy of the high level of this conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-07T18:29:55.807Z","updated_at":"2017-01-07T18:29:55.807Z"}]},{"id":8010,"state":"submitted","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2017-01-13T18:34:46.858Z","updated_at":"2017-01-13T18:34:46.858Z","additional_info":"N/A, I was speaking at the last Saturn conference in San Diego","rating":25.5,"trust":28.5714285714286,"tag_list":[],"profile":{"name":"Alexander von Zitzewitz","bio":"Alexander von Zitzewitz is founder, managing director of the company and CEO of the US subsidiary.

This presentation suggests a simple process you can follow to perform a rapid assessment of any software architecture effort regardless of its size, complexity or stage of development. The focus is on capturing the most critical aspects of the software architecture including: (a) Software Quality Attributes; (b) Key Architectural Decisions (including hardware platforms, software technology, development tools and reuse strategy); and (c) Architectural Design (primarily in the form of Unified Modeling Language or UML). Emphasis is placed on identifying and documenting references to existing artifacts. It generally requires an interview with the most knowledgeable software engineer on the proposal, development or maintenance team to identify the location of artifacts that are available and information that has never been documented. This is basically a two-day process. On the first day information is gathered and quickly recorded. On the second day, the information is analyzed, expert opinion(s) formulated, and a report is prepared and disseminated to all of the relevant Stakeholders.

The performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a non-functional requirement that is used as an acceptance criteria for almost every project / system. Performance SLA also impacts the usability and user adoption rate after the system goes live. However, performance issues usually show up during the later phases of the project or during system implementation such as Load / Stress Test and / or User Acceptance Test (UAT) when data volume scales up. The probable cause is a lack of defined architecture quality attributes and vague non-functional requirements on performance at the early stage of the project such as architectural design. This presentation is to conceive and show how to salvage a troubled project with performance SLA issues that focuses on performance and storage trade-offs, and how Architecture Analysis Tradeoff Method (ATAM) is used to leverage the performance and storage trade-offs. I will discuss detailed issue resolution approaches to address performance concerns from end-to-end. I will also present examples of real-world implementation on performance and storage trade-offs to turn the project around in a very short period of time to meet performance SLA.     ","notes":"This presentation is based on my real-world experiences in salvaging two multiple-million dollar projects in a very short period. Neither project conducted architecture quality attributes workshop (QAW). The performance issues were so severe that the projects were subject to be cancelled. The root of causes were extensive data aggregation with heavy computation and sorting on a low-end databases. One of the two projects simply tried to reuse a simple mobile application architecture with 2 search criteria and less than 100 thousand records on a PostgreSQL to a full blown application with 100 million records and over 20 search criteria. When performance issues appeared at UAT, $2 million dollars were already invested in the project. I will present a quick turnaround with tailored solutions ranging from increasing hardware / network capacity, database tuning / query optimization, API optimization, to the implementation of Solr or Elasticsearch to address the performance issue. The architectural dynamics, challenges, and impacts such as Solr indexing time impact to the existing ETL process and PaaS issues will also be presented. The practical knowledge of this presentation will benefit architects and business decision makers to understand the important of Architecture Quality Attributes and how to address performance issues with tailored solutions.  \r\n\r\nI think the presentation belongs to Track 3: Other topics interest - Addressing quality attribute concerns, such as performance, availability, usability, security, and interoperability","abstract":"Why do so many projects have system performance issues at a later stage of implementation?

OpenGrok is written in Java, and is designed around the concept of cookies on every page (including the front page), and thus effectively cannot be cached or accelerated through a naive approach, due to the original architectural decisions that were made without considering their impact on the cacheability of the application.

I'll answer each question in turn below.\r\n\r\nAs this will be a hands on talk, what will participants need to bring with them to participate? \r\n-  Participants will need a laptop with git and node installed, an internet connection, and accounts on Amazon AWS and Github.  \r\n\r\nAlso, what tech stack will you be using during the session?\r\n-  Full-stack Javascript: Angular.js on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end.  We'll use DynamoDB as the no-SQL database.  We'll also be discussing (and may use) some of the serverless frameworks like serverless.js or claudia.js.\r\n\r\nI like that this is planned to be hands on and that you plan to discuss migration paths. We’ve had a lot of proposals around server-less architecture and only a few will be accepted.\r\n-  Thank you!  We'll walk through taking an existing web application and refactoring routes over to a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.  Depending on time, we may get into testing, deployment, and other advanced topics.\r\n\r\nIn what situations would you recommend someone not adopt server-less architectures?\r\n-  The biggest benefits for serverless are 1) decreased complexity for developers - abstracting away  server-level administration and devOps tasks and 2) lower costs for applications on VMs that spend time idling.  So, for those that have a mature, stable, and effective devOps infrastructure that already abstracts server complexity from developers and for those whose VMs don't have much idle computing time, transitioning to serverless probably isn't going to be cost/risk-effective.  \r\n\r\n- There may be other reasons to not transition: risk aversion (\"this is too new and unproven\"), compliance (\"we neither own the data center NOR manage any of the VM infrastructure??\"), or simple mistrust (\"how do I know it's going to scale when I really need it to?\") It's important that application architects take into consideration their corporate policies, compliance and risk requirements, and organizational change tolerance when considering serverless.","created_at":"2016-12-19T19:19:47.874Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T19:19:47.874Z"},{"id":2928,"submission_id":7119,"talk_id":13610,"user":{"name":"David Aktary","avatar":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/5152/2013_THR_David_Headshot.jpg","email":"aktaryda@gmail.com"},"body":"Apologies for the odd message formatting above...

As we get deeper there will be more dependencies which it make it difficult to decompose the application.\r\n•\tIt is important Identify the business capability and design the contract accordingly. It architecture should be aligned with product owner and clearly articulates the problem the specific micro service is solving.  \r\n•\tUse domain driven design as much as possible. It is important to define the domain and the bounded context for the micro service. This also helps to define the granularity of the micro service. If the service is too big, it replicates the monolithic. Maintainability and agility should be kept in mind while designing the micro service.\r\n•\tArchitect should focus on the API contract, interplay of micro services, and ensuring the non-functional requirements are met. It is important for the architect to know where to stop in the design\r\n•\tWhat you design for real time may not work for batch\r\n\r\nDevops :\r\n\r\n•\tBenefit of micro services is speed of development. Unless the code migration and deployment is automated, it is diffuclt to manage a micro services factory\r\n•\tAutomate integration  testing and performance testing\r\n•\tWith micro services, there will be frequent release. Hence, doing blue green deployment helps to minimize the down time\r\n•\tA cloud first approach works better for micro services\r\n•\tATDD is a mandatory for micro services\r\n\r\nBest practices and culture:\r\n•\tEncourage Small teams of 4-5. If a micro service takes more than 1-2 developer to understand fully, it is too big and will become unmanageable\r\n•\tEncourage pair programming\r\n•\tEncourage knowledge sharing. Leverage demos to ensure teams get the big picture. Otherwise, developers will know only their micro service and miss the big picture.\r\n•\tWith small teams, teams slowly have to graduate to full stack teams that can do everything the micro service need\r\n\r\nCommunication to stake holders:\r\n\r\n•\tIt is important to communicate to clients often and in detail.

Now for a proper review from me and not just a procedural comment.  \r\n\r\nI think lessons learned building microservices is a great topic and it's great to see that we, as a community, are getting a few more experience reports / case studies from teams who are actually using the patterns.  Things I like about this talk: there is a ton of good advice born from real experience covering a range of topic areas that all have to work to get microservices working.  Things I worry about with this talk: there are a ton of topics to cover in 30 minutes and some of it is common advice that has been around for a few years now.\r\n\r\nI generally like what you've proposed and appreciate the focus on lessons based on your experience.  My advice, if this talk is accepted, is to try to tighten the focus and reduce scope or to think about ways to \"chunk\" your advice for easier consumption.  Also think about how you'll reinforce your advice with examples from your experience.

In particular, a dependable CPS responds correctly and timely even in situations where system parts have failed, either temporarily or permanently. This requirement also applies when tests check reliability, availability and performance properties of these systems in the field.\r\n\r\nTests of such systems pose various challenges, for example (1) stimulating selected system parts with correct data and with faulty data in rare and critical situations, (2) checking selected system parts at selected points in time, or during time intervals according to focused and measurable test goals, (3) differentiation of the system's treatment of permanent and temporary faults, and (4) absolute non-disturbance of the tested system's functionality or timing. The fourth challenge applies in particular to fault-injection tests that check system safety, or that operate near the border between the CPS and the physical process.\r\n\r\nMeeting the challenges outlined above requires that the architecture of the system under evaluation be designed for testability. Starting from here, we first characterize the system we use as an example: an integration platform of an X-by-wire eCar (www.projekt-race.de/en). This motivates the need for reliable statements on the real-time behavior of the system from different tests, from which we derive testability requirements. Afterwards, we elaborate a series of design tactics that enable or improve the system’s testability, focusing on test probes. A test probe is a kind of Built-in Monitor (SEI: Testability tactic) or Maintenance Interface (R. Hanmer: Patterns for fault-tolerant systems) with particular demands in probe environments. When these demands are fulfilled, test probes can execute deterministic, efficient and reliable real-time tests, or act as safety monitors that observe and potentially intervene in a system.","notes":"","abstract":"We rely on the functional safety of fault-tolerant, cyber-physical systems (CPS). Reliable statements from tests executed by test probes provide strong arguments in dependability cases.

Obtain tips and tools for ensuring your pipelines and DevOps infrastructure have the right architecture and feature-set to support your software production as it scales, while also ensuring manageability, governance, security, and compliance. \r\n\r\nLearn best practices for how to:\r\n\r\n1) Plan for scale: how to project for the types of performance indicators/vectors you’d need to scale across.\r\n2) How to design of your pipeline and supporting infrastructure and operations (such as data retention, artifact retrieval, monitoring, etc.).\r\n3) Design your pipeline workflows and processes to allow reusability and standardization across the organization, while also enabling flexibility to support the needs of specific teams/apps.\r\n4) Design your pipeline in a way that enables fast rollout- easy onboarding thousands of applications, across hundreds of teams\r\n5) Incorporate security access controls, approval gates and compliance checks as part of your pipeline and have them standard across all releases\r\n6) Ensure your architecture support HA, DR and business continuity.\r\n","notes":"This is designed to be a joint session with Electric Cloud CTO, Anders Wallgren: Anders Wallgren is chief technology officer at Electric Cloud.

Business leaders who rely on information to make complex decisions in real time could not succeed as desired because technology could not cope up with their needs till today. This decades’ long wait has finally come to an end thanks to Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Analytics. Especially Real Time Analytics powered by In-Memory Computing (IMC) offers a way out from this rut. Further still, a truly disruptive hybrid model that shrewdly mixes both, “Relying on the past to predict the future” and “Real Time Analytics” is a fool proof approach for digital era analytics solutions. \r\n \r\nBy embedding a select array of Artificial Intelligence techniques from cognitive research arena right into the core algorithms and using state of the art research projects such as SRI, CNTK and Google Tensor Flow, how we can leverage In Memory Computing to address predictive business analytics issues will be addressed in this session.\r\n\r\nHow to address complex and strategic decision needs in real time?\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nBy flexing and blending a variety of technologies within the realm of In Memory Computing, we can address all the three types of decisions, including Operational, Tactical and Strategic. While operational and tactical decisions tap into existing datamarts and datastores which house transactional, structured data, strategic decision making goes beyond the traditional stores and rely heavily on real time, unstructured data influx. \r\n\r\nReal time strategic decision making in digital era is impossible unless we shatter today’s speed and scale barriers. For speed, we can leverage In Memory Computing that tackles both latent and live streams of data. For planet scale, as the volume is huge and expected to grow exponentially, an on-demand, scalable infrastructure should be erected to contain the catastrophes. As strategic decisions need to factor in various parameters, an ensemble of machine-learning algorithms are employed to crunch data, to classify the outliers and recommend meaningful actions to deal with a specific problem at hand. An enormous number of simulations, trained models and tests are applied to the data which has been acquired and prepared before passed on to the intelligent analytics engine to arrive at precise real-time business decisions.\r\n\r\nApplied IMC Use case - Customer Intimacy \r\n==================================\r\n\r\nAs the world is becoming more complex by the moment, strategic decision making in real time is also becoming extremely difficult and is compounded by the speed and scale with which information is generated and consumed. IMC furthers the decision-making process by employing cutting-edge tools, and conceiving and deploying disruptive models to address customer concerns. When it comes to meaningful engagement with customers, relying on heuristics and instinctive impulses for strategic making is no longer reliable, in today’s rapidly changing digital landscape.\r\n\r\nThis session is designed to shed some light on a practical use case on how to enhance customer intimacy using In-Memory Computing for business analytics.\r\n\r\n\r\n","notes":"Functions and Algorithms\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThe driving force behind the use case is ‘enhancing customer experience’. With this is in mind, every customer interaction is funneled for use in a sentiment analysis. By examining every chat, email, tweet, voice transcript and logs, the attitudes, emotions, likes, preferences, habits behind the interactions are analysed using the following (indicative) machine and deep learning algorithms:\r\n\t\r\nNaïve Bayes\r\nMax ENT\r\nSVM\r\nCNN, HMM, GMM, \r\nDNN, RNN, LSTM\r\n\r\nArchitecture behind Real-Time In- Memory Analytics \r\n==========================================\t\r\nThe following  architecture principles are applied in Predictive Real-Time Business Analytics :\r\n\r\n* Real Time, In Memory Process.\r\n* Loose coupling.\r\n* Interoperability.\r\n* Modularity.\r\n* Scalability with built in CAPS.\r\n* Cloud Centric.\r\n* Mobile Centric.\r\n\r\nBy design Highly stable, open source products are plugged into the solution.\r\n","abstract":"Till today technology has failed business leaders miserably who wanted information to make complex decisions in real time.

In your abstract, you say technology has miserably failed business leaders who wanted information to make complex decisions in real time. I'd rather say technology has often fallen short instead of failed miserably. Likewise, I think it's an overstatement to say that AI and real-time analytics are the single largest contributor to customer relations in history. What about the Internet? And another example of what sounds to me like an overstatement: \"Real time strategic decision making in digital era is impossible unless we shatter today’s speed and scale barriers\".\r\n\r\nI have a few suggestions from the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program:\r\n\r\n1) Description: The third paragraph under \"Disruptive Intelligence\" is one long sentence.

I think you should simplify the motivation part of the description and focus more on the technical presentation. And it turns out the technical part of the talk is a little vague. Are you going to talk about general solutions to real-time analytics and IMC? Or about a specific (of set of) solution/design/technology/framework/tool? Or is it a case study? \r\n\r\n3) Description: It's not clear what attendees will learn. For example, in the Notes you mention \"Architecture behind Real-Time In-Memory Analytics\".

I'm very interested in the topic of software quality, but I'm sorry to say that I'm finding your description a little perplexing.\r\n\r\nThe title is confusing me.  My initial thought was that you were saying \"Software Quality Attributes Considered Harmful.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, reading the introduction paragraph makes me think you are actually saying is \"Poor Quality is Risky\", or perhaps \"A Little Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing\" because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly.\r\n\r\nBy \"essentially complex\" do you mean \"necessarily complex\"?  i.e.  This is the level of complexity that is needed as a minimum, you cannot go any simpler than this?\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"essentially complex\" do you actually mean that the model is complex by nature.  Complexity is often seen as a undesirable, , so complex nature could be a bad thing.\r\n\r\nReading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base.  Am I right in thinking that this is the \"Essentially complex quality model.\"  Since you are presenting it, then I assume it must be a good thing.  The title and introduction don't make this clear.\r\n\r\nAlso, you begin the second paragraph referring to \"some at the SEI.\"  You then refer to \"We\".

I am using \"essential complexity\" as Fred Brooks does.  DNA, the London subway, and Einstein's theory of relativity are each more complex than a triangle or benzene molecule.  \r\n\r\n\"Essential complexity\" is neither bad nor good.  It is a scalar characteristic, like weight.  By definition, if I build a model or solve a problem, the essential complexity of the thing being modeled or the problem being solved determines the essential complexity of an accurate model or an effective solution.\r\n\r\nWhile understanding higher levels of essential complexity is very difficult, simplistic understanding can be dangerous.  If the software in a self-driving car is simplistic, people will die needlessly.  \r\n\r\n“A Simplistic Quality Model is a Dangerous Thing” because you need one that is big enough to do the job properly. – Yes   Complexity is often seen as undesirable, [just like too much weight], so complex nature could be a bad thing – No [Human intelligence is not a bad thing, but unnecessary complexity is a bad thing.]  Reading on I see that you are presenting a quality knowledge base. Am I right in thinking that this is the “Essentially complex quality model.” – Yes\r\n\r\nHere is the rewrite:  Qualities are Very Complex\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of a project, you should identify likely project risks.  Quality goals may be among them.  These goals must be defined, achieved, and verified.  We show that current quality models are simplistic and then describe a quality model of sufficient complexity.\r\n\r\nWe highlight the features of a quality knowledge base that outlines over 60 quality attributes, their support and conflict relationships, and their tactics for goal definition, achievement, and verification.  This knowledge base is freely available and enables you to identify your quality goals and strategies at the beginning of a project.  If you don’t use it, you may waste time and increase project risk.\r\n\r\nImprovement suggestions much appreciated.  Thanks.","created_at":"2017-01-03T21:13:46.562Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T21:13:46.562Z"},{"id":3048,"submission_id":6786,"talk_id":12965,"user":{"name":"Paulo Merson","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd120cfc0f03fa3269cd067092389770?s=500","email":"paulomerson@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks for the submission.

I think we need techniques that make specification, design, and validation of quality goals simple and practical. IMO, a “quality model of sufficient complexity” doesn’t sound very enticing to the agile, framework-oriented developer of today.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with all but the word \"simple\".  The set of quality attributes and some individual attributes like safety and security are NOT simple (just like DNA).  Some attributes have entire books written about them. Their specification, design, and verification is NOT simple.\r\n\r\nI understand that I am \"selling\" complexity (reality?), but the earth is not flat and orbits are not circular.  Simplistic models of quality attributes will never produce predictable quality.\r\n\r\nAs to enticing the Agile crowd, there are many problems.  I have written that \"Agile is a Quality Antipattern\" and \"Fixing Agile\".  \"Pure\" agile is simplistic.  It can work great as long as you ignore quality goals.  These goals don't fit the Agile paradigm because they should be identified and specified early and achieved and verified in every iteration.  In surveys of current Agile practice, over 50% of the responders don't following any coding standards.  These Agile projects build huge quality debt starting from the first increment.

Being an expert you are doing your best guess to make initial draft cycle. And after that you are driving verification of your best guess vs opinion of representatives from customer. If you have representatives who are technical enough - they can provide you with good feed-back on your \"guessed\" attributes and improve your metrics.

It is based on the experience of an Architect who prepares his/her best guesses about set of quality attributes and related metrics. 2. As the next step, Architect drives the workshop in a pretty dynamic manner, moving with technologists from customer side checking proposed list of attributes and metrics (by improving list of key attributes and getting threshold values from representatives' side). 3. Formed list of attributes is ranked by priority with technologists of customer. 4. Short meeting with business stakeholders is conducted in order to review formed list of attributes and metrics and checking priorities. 5. Work is done and list of attributes and related metrics is formed.\r\n\r\nSuch approach works extremely good when: 1. There are available technologists on customer side. 2. There are some ready-to-use expectations/understanding about future system performance/availability/etc on customer side.","abstract":"QAW is too massive.

Unfortunately, many customers, managers, and developers have little understanding of how to specify, achieve, or verify quality goals.  Barry Boehm ranks qualities among his top 10 sources of serious project risk.\r\n\r\nThe SEI recommends that quality goals be identified in Quality Attribute Workshops (QAWs).  QAWs identify quality goals indirectly with scenarios and rely on “quality experts” to map scenarios onto quality goals.  Unfortunately, this indirect approach does not help customers make tradeoff decisions because of their poor understanding of quality relationships.  While scenarios are useful in describing some quality attributes, such as aspects of performance, they are not as useful for others, such as safety.\r\n\r\nWe propose an alternative approach based on the tailoring of a comprehensive quality attribute model to the needs of a project.  The model contains over 60 quality attributes.  Each attribute has over 30 characteristics including indicators and measures, supporting and conflicting qualities, threats and mitigations, and achievement and verification tactics.  The model also contains guidance on defining, achieving, and verifying quality goals.  The model is freely available at quality-aware.com.\r\n\r\nThis model distinguishes external qualities (visible to users e.g. reliability) from internal qualities (only visible to developers e.g. code readability).  We propose that goals for relevant external qualities be identified and defined in a tailoring workshop that includes most stakeholders.  Internal quality goals should be identified and defined in a meeting of technical management and senior developers.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will review the attributes model and simulate a tailoring workshop.","notes":"","abstract":"Identification of quality goals is hindered by poor understanding of quality attributes.

I'm familiar with cyclomatic complexity, we use sonarqube in our organization, and we follow the \"automate all the things\" motto. I was reading the description and wondering if cognitive complexity could be something analyzable by sonarqube (or other static code analysis tool). When I read in the Description that in this talk I would learn a method to calculate a Cognitive Complexity score, then I imagined the worst: 'it's not automated yet.'  Only when I saw the notes I realized it's automated and, better yet, part of sonarqube. \r\nSo, my suggestion is to make clear in the Description that this approach is automated. I think you should also mention it will be part of the sonarqube ecosystem soon. \r\n\r\n- You may already be planning to, but I suggest clarifying whether cognitive complexity should replace or complement cyclomatic complexity analysis. In other words, in my quality index formula, should I use both, maybe with different weights?  \r\n\r\n- SATURN is focused on software architecture and different code analyses bring a lot of design insight. So, I also suggest drawing a connection between cognitive complexity and design quality. \r\n","created_at":"2017-01-18T02:47:12.638Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T02:47:12.638Z"},{"id":3401,"submission_id":7615,"talk_id":14500,"user":{"name":"G.

Okay, not really, but you are providing the equivalent as your user experience. This hurts your <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/responsive-design-ranking-factor-228464\">SEO potential</a>, and drives traffic away from your site.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s get a quick rundown on what responsive web design actually means within the context of an ordinary website. This definition from <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2013/05/what-is-responsive-web-design.html\">Small Business Trends</a> sums it up nicely:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Responsive Web design is an approach whereby a designer creates a Web page that “responds to” or resizes itself depending on the type of device it is being seen through. That could be an oversized desktop computer monitor, a laptop, a 10-inch tablet, a 7-inch tablet, or a 4-inch smartphone screen.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>So with this in mind, let’s take a look at hypothetical look at a website on a few different devices.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=690%2C224&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"multiple-devices\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=600%2C195&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/multiple-devices.png?resize=720%2C234&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\r\n<p>Guys…. Stop thinking about coffee and let’s focus!</p>\r\n<p>Maybe the importance of this isn’t really seeping in and maybe you’re more of a numbers person… Let’s try another route.</p>\r\n<p>80% of internet users own a smartphone per <a href=\"http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/\">Smart Insights</a>. According to <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/why_marketers_should_keep_sending_you_emails\">MicKinsey &amp; Company</a>, Google says 61% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site they had trouble accessing and 40% visit a competitor’s site instead. A report by <a href=\"http://visual.ly/mobile-web-usage-2015-and-onwards\">Wolfgang Jaegel</a> found that 91% of mobile users say that access to content is very important.</p>\r\n<p>In all seriousness, it is a big deal if your site does not work on mobile devices. Think about the kittens!!  And if you’re thinking, “there aren’t THAT many devices out there,” and “it can’t be THAT hard to be responsive,” think about those kittens one final time.</p>\r\n<p>I am sure there is a number out there on the internet waiting to be found telling us how many devices are web capable, and <a href=\"https://www.perfectomobile.com/list-of-supported-devices\">I am also sure it’s large</a>. Keep in mind each device is designed differently, with different software requirements, default browsers, and different hardware specs. That means, as a developer, no matter what you’re building, you will likely find yourself daydreaming of how many kittens you’d prefer were being hit in the face, while you debug the fifth CSS error you encounter in Safari, that never existed in Chrome&#8230;Sorry, that got a bit personal.</p>\r\n<p>As much as I would like to believe my iPhone is having an identity crisis, that’s not the actual case. There are standards out there for web design (sometimes sketchy ones), that are intended to help developers and browsers work within boundaries that help to simplify things. And I know what you’re thinking.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you, mobile gods. We’re saved!</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"design-gods\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/design-gods.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\r\n<p>But we haven’t quite saved those kitties just yet.</p>\r\n<p>You may still be thinking, “Why do you need to know all this?”</p>\r\n<p>If you’re a business owner looking to increase your audience and you haven’t taken the responsive route, that should be the first thing on your to-do list. Online shopping is already a huge trend and still growing at this rate. If you’re trying to get your blog out there over a product, what better place for someone to read that than on their device while in the restroom? I mean really… we’ve all done it…</p>\r\n<p>If you’re looking to get a better <a href=\"http://www.marketpath.com/digital-marketing-insights/8-reasons-to-have-a-responsive-web-design-infographic\">return on your investment (ROI)</a>, responsiveness is another way to do that. If you do not have a fully responsive design, you are throwing away potential page views and potential dollars pulled in from your mobile shoppers.</p>\r\n<p>Now onto saving all those kittens!</p>\r\n<p>If you’re not familiar with WordPress or its standards, there are these things called themes. I mean, to take it directly from the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes\">WordPress Codex</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. These files are called template files. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>To put it simply, a theme is the look and feel of your site via functionality and design. It’s the idea that you can do anything with your content within the provided templates and have a consistent and clean flow.</p>\r\n<div><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=690%2C376&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"elegant-themes\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?w=970&amp;ssl=1 970w, https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=600%2C327&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/pressable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/elegant-themes.jpg?resize=720%2C392&amp;ssl=1 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p>Popular WordPress themes from Elegant Themes</p></div>\r\n<p>There are thousands of themes out there to pick from. Whether you’re building a store front, a restaurant front and menu, a non-profit donation location, a blog, or an educational site, there is something out there for you. There are many free options, usually offered through the CMS that’s been installed, and paid options that tend to be found via outside sources.</p>\r\n<p>So get to searching for the responsive theme that fits your needs, either through <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a> or through a seller like <a href=\"https://themeforest.net\">ThemeForest</a>. The kittens will thank you.</p>\r\n<p>If you go searching and nothing seems to catch your eye (insert joke about cats chasing the red dot of doom), there are always custom themes. This is the option for businesses that are looking for a specific look or functionality that they can’t find anywhere else. Being unique can be a huge benefit to a business with the right design and implementation. This is a costlier option but usually has a higher turn around on traffic and offers more options for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and design tactics. Marketing teams usually love this option!</p>\r\n<p>That’s it, that’s all you have to do.</p>\r\n<p>As developers, we have to do much much MUCH more to make something like a custom theme or purchased theme modifications (maybe I’ll write about that in the future for all the dev-heads out there wanting to help the kitties), but as a website owner using WordPress, that’s all you have to do; find a theme that is responsive. You can look more into the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack plugin</a> to help with SEO as well (yet, again, maybe another post for the future).</p>\r\n<p>So get out there and start saving those kittens! I believe you will make the right decision!</p>\r\n<p>Also, if you need some emergency kittens, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmrgencyKittens\">go here.</a> You’re welcome.</p>\r\n","notes":"This talk is great for those who are just starting to learn CSS or web design, but still helpful to those who have been creating sites for a few years.

The tutorial will cover why web security testing is important, what vulnerabilities are most common and how the ZAP tool can help developers check their software for these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe good and to improve:\r\nPrevious experience and presentations are listed, which increases the confidence that the presenter can deliver the material well. I like the fact that a live demo will be included. A video of a previous speaking engagement would be appreciated. I think this may be needed to get the confidence that the English accent of the speaker is easily understood.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the talk is on testing and the author’s experience includes mostly developer conferences. It is unclear how the talk’s take-aways are relevant for architects, clarification on this point would be helpful. For example, does ZAP help applying design patterns? That said, many developers attend SATURN and many architects code.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes listed are ambitious for a 15-min talk. It runs the risk of becoming a sales pitch for ZAP and an invitation to contribute to the project. Which leads to the following idea.\r\n\r\nIdea:\r\nI think the Technical Talks and Tutorials track may be more suitable.

I am just using a tool to help me find the vulnerabilities in web application so that developer can know and build application more securely.\r\n\r\nIf my talk is accepted under Technical Talks and Tutorial track (assuming each talk will be given 1hr duration), my talk will be following below structure:\r\n\r\n-> Importance of Web Secuirty - 5min\r\n-> Discussing OWASP Top 10 vulneribities [Each vulnerabity will take 2min for discussion] - 20min \r\n-> Talking about 4 available open source tools [4 tools X 5min] - 20min\r\n-> Live Demo [Scanning vulnerable web application to detect vulnerabilities and various other features of the tool] - 10min\r\n-> QA - 5min\r\n\r\nAbout ZAP: \r\nThe OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world’s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by hundreds of international volunteers.

Some call it the age of digitalization. No matter what you call it, we are harvesting more and more data about people and businesses. This data is then connected to other data and exposed as services which needs to be protected properly. As software architects, our primary security goal is to write secure software. Secure software has a technical aspect that is well covered (if not understood) in developer literature, but there is also a human and organizational aspect of security we as software architects must manage.  These aspects often go beyond the boundaries of the software development organization and are influenced by forces well beyond the company walls.\r\n\r\nOn the path to security there are a lot of trade-offs to be made, and some of these are made outside the IT organization. After working for more than 20 years in large organizations, I have found that there are certain signals that can be used to identify if you have a weak security culture. They do not necessarily identify security problems in themselves, but are indicators of topics that merit further investigation.\r\n\r\n__In this talk I will cover topics such as:__\r\n\r\n- Balancing prevention, detection and response\r\n- Leadership\r\n- Balancing Short term gains vs long time security impact\r\n- Handling security incidents\r\n- The importance of the curious mind\r\n- Communicating security concerns beyond the IT organization\r\n","notes":"__Note: This talk was originally submitted as a 30 minute talk.

It seems PaperCall has a glitch with the talk format dropdown.  Sorry about that.\r\n\r\nI have a few suggestions from the perspective of a conference participant looking at the conference program:\r\n\r\n1. In the Description, you say there is also a human and organizational aspect of security we must manage. I find that a little vague. Could you give examples of human and organizational security aspects that architects need to manage?\r\n\r\n2. In the Description, you mention there are signals to identify a weak security culture. You could say explicitly that you will discuss these signals in the presentation--I sure hope that's the case.\r\n\r\n3. Consider adding what participants will learn, that is, how do they benefit from this talk. \r\n\r\n4.

From our history of monolithic systems, then distributed systems, to Internet connected systems, we are now entering the era of cloud-hosted, microservice based, pay-for-usage system development. What does the history of software architecture tell us about the challenges of this new environment? And how does our approach to software architecture need to evolve in order to meet them?\r\n\r\nSoftware architecture has been a mainstream discipline since the 1990s and in that time has become a recognised, widely researched and often valued part of the software engineering process. However architecture approaches must reflect the technologies and priorities of the systems we are building and in this regard its future has never looked more uncertain or more exciting. \r\n\r\nFrom our history of monolithic compile time architecture, to many tiered distributed systems, to Internet connected services, we are now entering the era of cloud-hosted, microservice-based, pay-for-usage systems development. In this new world the boundaries of “my” system are no longer so clear and our systems are dissolving into complex webs of independently owned and evolved services, with nothing more in common than a shared credit card for billing and an agreement on the format of network requests. \r\n\r\nWhat can the history of software architecture tell us about the likely challenges in this environment?

Based on the past 16 years of his life, there is no question about the genius of this kid; but not so much can be said about some of his entourage and followers. Missteps in his career threw shadows of doubt at times about his potential. However, as he matured and opened up to his parents’ wisdom and history, he’s been able to build a well-rounded experience that’s making him competitive for the next phase of his life.\r\n\r\nI wrote my first full-fledge program (app in today’s term) in the Spring of 2001, around the same time Mr. Agile moved into my neighborhood. I didn’t get to know him until early 2004 when his entourage grew into a dedicated community of fans and followers. Back then, I had one trusted mentor and an old friend, Mr. Architecture. Becoming friends with Mr. Agile was new and exciting but brought about challenges to my relationship with my old friend. Therefore, my growing up as a software professional was about learning how I could maintain friendships with both, reconciling their differences, and being better at what I do because of it.  \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I grow up in this kid’s world. So what does that look like? \r\n\r\nIn this DEV@SATURN talk, I’ll narrate the story about growing up as friends with Mr. Agile and Mr. Architecture. I don’t intend to indulge the “agile vs architecture” debate. On the contrary, I’ll annotate my story with examples from our journeys together, sharing experiences with some of Mr. Agile’s friends who advocated architecture sabotage, as well as situations where the outcomes were better because I had a foot in both camps and had won the internal struggle as to how to reconcile.\r\n\r\nCome join me in this talk as I’m sure you’ll find resemblances to your own journey. ","notes":"<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>\r\nThis talk is inspired by Linda Northrop’s keynote last year when she gestured a fist-bump to her chest, a sign of regret, about the stall/damage agile movement did to the progress of architecture adoption. It made me reflect on how I’ve lived the collision of these two worlds. \r\n\r\nAfter discussing an early version of this draft with her, I thought I should write and share my experience in the form of a TED@SATURN talk.\r\n\r\nMy starting thought was the fact that being close to agile movement from the beginning propelled my growth as a software professional, and my practice of software development have been better for it. However, this didn’t come without a struggle against an entourage littered with misunderstanding, incompetence, and lack of discipline.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, it’s clear that the agile pendulum swung too far in the beginning in a zeal to fix the ills of non-agile approaches. But like all physical pendulums, this one had to come back to equilibrium as agile original proponents began to realize that they overlooked some methodology-neutral principles key to developing quality software, including architectural principles.  \r\n\r\nThe punch line in this talk is that at this point agile is a reality. We are at a stage where we need to forgo the discussion about agile for agile sake OR architecture for architecture sake. We need to embrace this agile pendulum equilibrium in the making, and regain the role of those who think about appropriate practices, regardless of methodology, to build high quality software – Software that is fit for its intended use, where fitness has many dimensions beyond pure functionality. \r\n\r\nThe vehicle for me to deliver this is through storytelling based on my own software journey. I'll try to dig out old pictures to put in the background to color the scene.  \r\n\r\n<h1>TALK STRUCTURE (DRAFT)</h1>\r\nFor the purposes of this segment of SATURN, my talk will feature a storyline emphasizing a classic story ingredients.\r\n\r\n<h2>Origination</h2> \r\nYear 2001. \r\nA dozen or so smart software engineers with stellar backgrounds are holding a collective grudge against waterfall-like processes, titles, and roles. Like many revolutions, a manifesto is crafted in a mysteriously remote venue, and subsequently shared with the world: Baby agile is born. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, my induction into the world of software development occurs. A baby software developer is born. \r\n\r\nScene – we live in the same neighborhood. \r\n\r\n<h2>Building towards a crisis</h2> \r\nTime is going to flyby quickly here. \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In the ensuing 10 years, agile grows to garnish a movement that dominates all descending voices challenging it. It's cool; it’s the buzz; and it’s unstoppable.</li>\r\n<li>I meet Mr. Agile for the first time. I’m fascinated (anecdotal incidence here). I go running to my old friend, Mr. Architecture. He’s less fascinated. (I get to know why later). </li>\r\n<li>It turns out, architecture best practices (and a lot of common sense) are the colloquial baby that was thrown out with the bathwater. Architecture vs Agile debate begins to take place. </li>\r\n<li>This makes me extremely uncomfortable. I like both my old friend and my new friend but how can I hang out with them both?</li> \r\n<li>Affiliated agile revolutionaries weren't grounded as leaders in software engineering thereby resulting in a number of documented software atrocities. I witness some of these first hand in my neighborhood.</li>\r\n<li>Moment of truth: Agile is widely accepted but now the epiphany – It isn't the silver bullet after all. Adults in the neighborhood have been saying so all along but the wave was too noisy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Beginning of resolution</h2> \r\nIn the last five years, architectural thinking begins to permeate the conversation among agile leaders. Voices of reason, architecture and agile leaders together, have begun to take charge of the discourse again. They’re beginning to have serious conversations about the real software development challenges at hand with a common goal to build software in a way that is both flexible and sustainable.\r\n\r\nI’m getting really uncomfortable as I now get to go out and watch game with both my old and new friends. (Anecdotal incidence here). \r\n\r\nGreat headways are achieved but also challenges remain with a hopeful future – that of bringing our community together and embracing each other’s strengths.  \r\n\r\n<h2>Ending Monolog</h2>\r\nWhile I feel privileged to have grown up with this boy and met & learned from many of his clique, my work experiences led me to also work in many cases with the cronies. So I finish the story with a call to action for the audience to avoid the dichotomy of us versus them and to regain our role as the chaperons of quality as manifested in the end-products and artifacts regardless of the adopted software development methodology.  \r\n\r\nCurtain close. Audience cheers. Lights off. \r\n\r\n:)","abstract":"If Agile Manifesto were a boy, he'd be a high school junior today. Based on the past 16 years of his life, there's no question about his genius.

A lot of focus is put on the *initial development* aspect, before the first delivery, and little attention is given to the *maintenance phase* of the software system. With more and more organizations shifting to SaaS models, creating long-lived Internet systems that aren’t forgiving to downtimes or cumbersome data migrations, maintenance becomes much more important and critical to the overall design of the system than the initial development.\r\n\r\nAgile offers a different, *Emergent* method to design software, with small iterations that, when combined with continuous delivery and learning, results in a design that’s much more adaptive to changing requirements. Taken to the extreme, we shorten the initial development phase to a minimum and focus mostly on iterative maintenance steps. \r\n\r\nHowever, the conditions required to facilitate Emergent Design require that the development team refrain from over-engineering and YAGNI violations - two problems that are prevalent in the software industry, especially with less-experienced engineers. Outside-In Development is a methodology that helps us focus on the Semantics rather the Mechanics of our software, protect us from YAGNI violations, and thus facilitate Emergent Design. Practicing TDD helps us implement this methodology in the scope of a commercial software project, by helping us cultivate a Beginner’s Mind towards software design.","notes":"I will start by describing the gap between how engineers usually view software design and how Internet-scale systems actually evolves. I will then make the point that software isn’t like bridges, cars or other “classical” engineering projects. I will use the biological analogy, talking about software as a garden and how we always build on existing system state, and how software engineering is an ongoing, evolving effort. I will claim that a paradigm shift is needed towards wide adoption of Emergent Design.\r\n\r\nNext, I will explain why traditional software engineering training is deleterious to this paradigm shift, with people learning to think about static, rather than evolving, software design, and are taught more about the mechanics of software (design patterns, technology) and less about the semantics (creating the right abstractions). I will discuss Outside-In Development and explain how it helps stick to the YAGNI principle, and how this facilitates Emergent Design. I will explain that it’s hard to adopt outside-in due to the way engineers are trained and how cultivating a Beginner’s Mind helps us put aside these problems and achieve outside-in.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will explain how practicing TDD helps us cultivate the Beginner’s Mind and facilitate outside-in, with test-first serving as the outside user of a system or subsystem, and how the Refactoring phase of TDD helps design emerge.\r\n\r\n### Presentation History:\r\nInitially developed in 2014 as an internal Wix.com tech talk.

Masinter, Intel Corporation \r\nNathan R. Peterson, Intel Corporation\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe Advanced Deterministic Random Number Generator (ADRNG) was developed at Intel Security for use with the many security products based upon the McAfee Linux OS platform. The ADRNG provides the NIST approved SP800-90A PRNG from the native Linux kernel API. It is continuously reseeded using high quality entropy bit data form the native Linux kernel Jitter entropy driver. This ADRNG is added to the Linux 4.4 kernel, and replaces the standard drivers for both /dev/random and /dev/urandom. The result is high quality random data delivered in high volume without call blocking.\r\n\r\nProblem/Opportunity\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe ability to provide a high volume of quality random data is of interest to modern Linux server systems where a great deal of encryption requires a great deal of random data. A lack of large quantities of random data may cause encryption to run slowly. A lack of quality in the random data may cause encryption to be weak. \r\n\r\nThe particular path that led us to develop this solution was increasing scrutiny of the NIST FIPS validation standards which are diving deeper into entropy quality. The ADRNG is based upon all the learning from a year long series of FIPS lab testing while validating McAfee Linux OS. \r\nQuality random data is in demande by all modern Linux servers, with or without FIPS requirements. By developing a standards based solution that plugs into the Linux kernel, we can easily share this solution with all groups at Intel, as well as making a significant contribution to the Linux kernel upstream.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe initial implementation of this idea was for the Linux 3.18 kernel. That kernel did not contain the native API for the SP800-90A PRNG nor the Jitter entropy driver. We back ported the Jitter enropy code from a later kernel, and adapted the SP800-90A routines from the Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) open source crypto library. This worked very well, but we were concerned about the large delta of kernel code required for this method.\r\n\r\nHowever since that time, we have moved to the Linux 4.4 kernel, which does contains both the SP800-90A PRNG and the Jitter entropy driver within the kernel native API. So we have updated our solution to use only the native kernel resources. This vastly reduces the size of code required, and also provides greater confidence for those that consume the solution.\r\nScope\r\n\r\nThe initial motivation to develop the ADRNG was to meet increasingly strict NIST FIPS standards. However we have enable this solution for all modes of the kernel. Thus all products based on McAfee Linux OS will benefit from the faster and higher quality random data. This results in faster and more secure encryption.\r\n\r\nMcAfee Linux OS is used by many products at Intel Security, and all of these products will implicitly inherit the advantages of the ADRNG as they each update to the lastest MLOS kernel. Increased security will benefit the reputation and sales of Intel Security products.\r\nEngineering teams working with cryptography on Linux systems, as well as Product Managers attempting to satisfy NIST FIPS standards, would all benefit from learning more about the ADRNG.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nFor measuring the results we quantify two values: Speed and Quality. \r\n\r\n### Speed Test\r\n+ Dell PE-R610 / Xeon E5540 / 2.53GHz\r\n\r\n.            64-Bytes  1K-Bytes  64K-Bytes  64Kx64-Bytes\r\n/dev/random  0m0.002s  0m0.002s  1h,36m,13s 103h,19m,46s\r\n/dev/urandom 0m0.002s  0m0.002s  0m0.008s   2m10.672s\r\nADRNG        0m0.002s  0m0.003s  0m0.036s   2m25.836s\r\n\r\nThe speed test was performed using this simple command for each algo and block size:\r\n$ time dd if=/dev/random of=/tmp/64_random.dat bs=64 count=1\r\n\r\nWe used memory based file system (/tmp/) to reduce file i/o overhead.\r\nWe can assume file i/o overhead is consistent between all tests, since all tests have the same number and size of writes.\r\n\r\n### Quality Test\r\n•\tDell PE-R610 / Xeon E5540 / 2.53GHz\r\n\r\n.             Entropy  Arithmetic-Mean     SCC\r\n/dev/random   7.999580    127.5092         -0.001245\r\n/dev/urandom  7.999960    127.4892         -0.000524\r\nADRNG         7.999962    127.5570         -0.001057\r\n\r\nEntropy bits per byte of perfect randomness = 8.000000\r\nArithmetic mean of perfect randomness = 127.5\r\nSerial Correlation Coefficient of totally uncorrelated data = 0.0\r\n\r\nThe quality test was performed using the “ent” program which applies various entropy quality tests to byte sequences. This test was run against the sum of all data produced by the speed test above, 4,260,928 bytes.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe ADRNG provides random data at the speed of /dev/urandom and with the quality of /dev/random. Thus crypto applications no longer need to choose between speed and quality, because the ADRNG provides both.\r\n\r\nLeadership\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe ADRNG will provide greater overall quality to all Intel products which incorporate it. The ISecG security products are measured in the industry by their speed and security. The ability to run encryption faster, and with higher quality, results is something that can be measured and leveredged by product marketing to maintain and extend the Intel Security market leadership.\r\n\f\r\nLessons Learned\r\nThere were so many lessons learned from the FIPS process that we could write a book on the subject. But in summary, to track and report quality, you must collect this info:\r\n\r\n+ FOR EACH: RNG, RNG-Seed, RNG-init, Entropy, Entropy-Seed, Entropy-init\r\n+ You must be able to show this info:\r\n+ Origin of algo\r\n+ Source code of algo\r\n+ Quality tests of algo\r\n+ Performance tests of algo on various hardware platforms\r\n+ Papers and Certifications of algo\r\n\r\nIt is far better to collect this info as you go through development, rather than going back at the end and attempting to compile this info.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n1.\tENT, a program which applies various entropy quality tests to byte sequences,   http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/\r\n2.\tNIST Special Publication 800-90A, Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators, Jan 2012, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf\r\n3.\tCPU Time Jitter Based Non-Physical True Random Number Generator, 2014, Stephan Müller, https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2014/ols2014-mueller.pdf\r\n","notes":"- I am the manager and co-founder of the McAfee Linux OS project at Intel Corp.

As Information Technology (IT) and Information Technology (OT) have been rapidly converging in recent years, new and emerging technologies have been introducing challenging issues to Cyber-Physical Systems, which play critical roles in Critical Infrastructure and Internet of Things (IoT). In addition, the visions of Smart City and Smart Industry demand core Cyber-Physical Systems technologies, including SCADA and M2M, to become more and more Mission-Critical.  To address complexity and uncertainty issues found in Cyber-Physical Systems, the author takes a systematic approach to study key requirements and constraints from Cyber, Physical and Human Factors perspectives, following System and Software Engineering’s principles. A number of key requirements, including availability, resilience, reliability, safety, security, and privacy, along with key constraints, such as dependency, performance, and scalability, are briefly discussed. The author then takes a holistic view to study and present the Cyber-Physical Systems’ Failure Model, which addresses Fault, Error, Failure, and their lifecycles, as well as their Risk Model, which focuses on Mental Model, Hazards and Accidents. The two models are then integrated into an Integrated View, from Cyber, Physical and Human Factor perspectives, to provide a foundation for the design of Intelligent Systems. Several key principles, including redundancy, diversity and human factors design, are applied to design for complexity and uncertainty issues. Two major functions of the designed Intelligent Systems, including Diagnosis and Decision Support, are then introduced. The designed system is then applied at an application scenario in Smart Traffic Management context. The author further discusses and reflects the design experience using model and simulation checking on the application scenario. This is followed by discussions on key lessons learnt, including limitations of the design. The presentation is concluded by introducing future research directions.","notes":"The design experience of Intelligent Software Systems presented in this presentation is based on the author’s Master’s in Software Engineering thesis at Oxford University in UK.

The role looks simple on paper: drive good, technical solutions to business problems. But with so much going on at any given moment and constant iteration, staying on top of and affecting outcomes across the board is practically impossible. If you can't even keep up, how can you find time to engage in the decision-making process?\r\n\r\nIn this environment, a 'command-and-control' style architect can encounter significant opposition and find themselves ineffective. Instead, we may consider exploring an entirely different approach. The Influential Architect is fusion of advisor, mentor, facilitator, communicator, and storyteller. As an Influential Architect, our aim is to improve outcomes across the organisation without the organisation becoming reliant on us making key decisions. To achieve this, we have to change the level of abstraction: where previously our purview has been decisions, we must now focus on people. When we can't be in every room where decisions are being made, we must affect the people who are and the process they use.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore what it means to be an Influential Architect, as well as some of the tools and techniques we can use to succeed. We'll cover:\r\n\r\n* Transparent Decision-making.\r\n    * How may we efficiently document and communicate our intentions with regards to technical solutions and what would those documents look like?\r\n    * How may we incorporate other development teams into our feedback cycle without creating bottlenecks?\r\n* The Light on the Hill.\r\n    * What is a technical vision and how does it help both the team and the wider organisation?\r\n    * How do we go about establishing a technical vision and who needs to be involved in this process?\r\n    * How do we hold teams accountable to technical visions, in order to ensure they work towards the same long-term goals?\r\n* Visual Storytelling.\r\n    * How can we effectively communicate technical outcomes to non-technical stakeholders?\r\n    * What are the key components of a good story and how does a story help communicate intentions?\r\n    * What does an example of a visual story that communicates a technical initiative look like?\r\n* Architectural Principles.\r\n    * What are architectural principles and why do we need them?\r\n    * How and in what format are architectural principles articulated?\r\n    * What does the process of establishing them look like to optimise for creating buy-in among technical teams?\r\n    * How may we hold teams accountable to the architectural principles we've established?\r\n* Sensible Defaults.\r\n    * How can we use sensible defaults to avoid reinventing the wheel while at the same time not hinder innovation?\r\n    * How do we go about establishing sensible defaults in an open and inclusive process?\r\n    * How do teams incorporate using sensible defaults in their work process?\r\n* Strategic Thinking.\r\n    * How can we champion long-term concerns in an iterative agile process?\r\n\r\nIn the longer version of the talk, we'll expand on the aforementioned tools by going through them in greater detail with several real-life examples, and also cover:\r\n\r\n* A case study of failures.\r\n    * What were the approaches that didn't work so well?\r\n    * Why did they fail and what can we learn from them?\r\n* Team suitability.\r\n    * Are there any _team_ characteristics that are necessary in order for an Influential Architect to be effective?\r\n    * What can we do to prepare teams for greater autonomy if they are not ready for it?\r\n* Architect suitability.\r\n    * Are there any _personal_ characteristics that significantly make this type of role easier to fulfil for the Influential Architect?\r\n* Evaluating outcomes.\r\n    * How do we measure our own success in influencing teams?\r\n    * How do we know which teams need more (or less) support than others?\r\n    * Under what circumstances might it be acceptable to stray from the technical vision?","notes":"This is probably best suited as a 30 minute talk, but can be expanded into a 90 minute talk if so desired. The presentation has no technical requirements other than a projector for the slides.\r\n\r\nMy presentations tend to be fun and engaging. I strive to offer ideas people can implement as soon as they get back from the conference, interwoven with self-deprecating humour. I gave a talk about Event Sourcing at last year's SATURN which was well received: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TeMYF_JjNg\r\n\r\nHaving lived and breathed the role of Influential Architect at Envato in Melbourne, Australia, I'm well-positioned to talk through the lessons I've learned throughout my journey. At Envato, we have 18 autonomous engineering teams working on several products in the digital marketplaces industry. Over 120 people are directly involved in the day-to-day development and delivery of software projects. As the only person with Software Architecture in my job title, I guide these teams and people to ensure that we are making sound technical descision and are all working towards the same technical vision.\r\n\r\nThe Influence approach we've been trialling at Envato has been very successful, with a transparent decision-making process and better outcomes. For the first time ever, we have a coherent long-term architectural vision that is understood and frequently referenced by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Teams are able to move faster, with the reassurance of knowing they are heading in the same direction as everyone else.\r\n\r\nI'm excited to share what I've learned about the role of a Software Architect at scale. The presentation is packed with advice on what's worked and what hasn't, and has concrete real-world examples rather than abstract ones. There should be interesting content for all types of architects even if they work in very different environments.","abstract":"In a company at scale with many fully autonomous and agile development teams, the architect's role is more about preventing entropy than it is setting direction.

There must be something other than leadership style at play?\r\n\r\nHow much does the team culture and experience play into success of the adopted leadership style?  What about the architect's experience?\r\n\r\nYou discuss only the positive benefits of this style of leadership.  I would think that empowering the team can have a downside if you don't find the right balance of vision and guidance.  How do you determine if your team is doing well with this approach or needs more oversight?\r\n\r\nI do not believe all teams are ready for this leadership approach.  How do you know if a team is ready and how do you prepare them to handle greater autonomy?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMichael","created_at":"2017-01-20T18:18:48.727Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T18:18:48.727Z"},{"id":3447,"submission_id":8114,"talk_id":15418,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Sebastian, apologies, I don't usually address people only by their last names -- I was moving too fast and read the wrong text!","created_at":"2017-01-20T18:21:49.067Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T18:21:49.067Z"},{"id":3463,"submission_id":8114,"talk_id":15418,"user":{"name":"Sebastian von Conrad","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c00089fa70bfc238069005c7b4fbd15f?s=500","email":"sebastian@vonconrad.com"},"body":"Anthony, \r\n\r\nThank you for your comments.

The word “stream” implies a continuous process, but in real life that stream is far from homogeneous. Architects (or whoever else owns the design decisions) find themselves making decisions with widely varying impact, based on information with differing levels of uncertainty, throughout the life of a software solution. On top of that, the way these decisions and their impact are communicated evolves as the audience and the focus of the architectural communication change.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we explore the metaphor of a human lifetime to illustrate various aspects of architectural decision making, throughout a software solution’s life cycle. Amid all the fluidity of the stream of design decisions, we will look for anchor points with common concerns to address and recurring communication needs. We will see how the nature of architectural decisions changes when we go from birth (the first architectural outline) to graduation (making the business case), and find guidance on communicating the architecture at times of life-defining milestones like marriage (committing to the architecture) and revolutionary changes to the solution. The points will be illustrated by real-life examples from an interesting case study.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial is based on Risk- and Cost-Driven Architecture, a popular approach to improve architecture practices in both traditional and agile contexts, with the aim of providing “just enough anticipation” in the architecture. No prior knowledge of RCDA is required to attend.","notes":"This is a 90-minute tutorial.\r\n\r\nDuring the product lifecycle, key aspects of architectural decisions change, depending on the life stage:\r\n\r\n* level of risk and cost control: the cone of uncertainty\r\n* available information to base architectural decisions on\r\n* impact of architectural decisions\r\n* number of architectural decisions\r\n* cost of change to the architecture\r\n\r\nCertain milestones like graduation (approving the business case for the solution) and marriage (the moment after which it becomes very expensive to change the architecture) occur in every solution life cycle. Such milesones lead to standard stakeholder concerns, like affordability, level of risk control and predictability. We use the commonality of these concerns to provide the architect with standard views in their documentation, enabling them to show how the architecture addresses these common concerns.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n1.

Since I don't have a full grasp of the software architecture domain I would start off by getting architects to understand the power of sketching, which is using sketching for ideation, iteration, and communication of ideas. The sketching activities are designed to show them how little time it takes to sketch and that anyone can sketch. After each activity, I ask the attendees to show their sketches to a person next to them to practice using sketching to communicate.\r\n\r\nDevelopers can then take this knowledge and firsthand experience and apply it to their workflow/processes the very next day. \r\n\r\nTo make a stronger connection with the conference topic I can add a specific software architecture sketching activity. I will do some research on which activity can be included in the talk.\r\n\r\nI hope I have answered you questions. :) I am also open to any ideas you might have as well.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRizwan\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-14T22:23:42.142Z","updated_at":"2017-01-14T22:23:42.142Z"},{"id":3289,"submission_id":7973,"talk_id":15153,"user":{"name":"Michael Keeling","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4be446077e88a0bd8ada5d375bb3fef5?s=500","email":"michael.keeling@gmail.com"},"body":"Thanks, Rizwan.

In this talk we'll examine the factors that lead to this disconnect between the architecture and the code. We'll learn that consequences of this problem go beyond maintainability issues.

However his hypothesis became known as Conway’s law and many organizations can say that they have observed the same behaviors as outlined in Melvin’s original paper. \r\n\r\nHere at IBM Watson, we just completed an initial release of a new microservice-based cloud platform. This service involved multiple teams, multiple microservices and multiple timezones.  We took a cloud product from inception on a lightening fast roller coaster ride to GA in five months, and lived to tell the story. We didn’t get everything right, but we learned alot along the way and we’d like to share those learnings. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will share our experience, and talk about some of the architectural successes and mistakes we made. We’ll talk about how we used Conway’s law, and the inverse Conway manuever to correct some of those mistakes. We’ll also touch on some of the issues confronting our teams with remote team members and how we solved them. We’ll provide a prescription for approaching team architecture based on our learnings. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the presentation, attendees will gained a knowledge of Conway’s law, how to use it to their advantage, and how to take an architecture led focus for team creation and development. \r\n\r\n","notes":"This will be a slide-based presentation with the following tentative outline:\r\n\r\n* Problem statement: Architecting teams is hard to get right the first time.

Thank you. I agree that it would be very applicable to talk about success and failures - due to architectural modularization issues (through Conway's) vs the actual microservices implementation. This distinction is actually quite relevant - as it will allow us to think about how much of an impact a microservices architecture has on top of a modularized team approach, whether positive or negative. I will add that to the agenda.\r\nYou raise a very interesting point about the \"luck\" of being rejected by HBR. What a fascinating topic- you could well imagine that if it had been accepted by HBR - that it could have been missed entirely by the software architecture community and perhaps it would have sprouted more generally into other communities of practice. This is a perfect \"What if\" scenario and will fit nicely into the talk as food for thought.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-20T17:54:33.378Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T17:54:33.378Z"}]},{"id":8177,"state":"submitted","confirmed":false,"created_at":"2017-01-16T21:36:06.450Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T21:36:06.450Z","additional_info":"This is a talk I gave about Android libraries beginners should use: https://realm.io/news/360andev-chris-guzman-android-libraries-beginner/","rating":1.0,"trust":28.5714285714286,"tag_list":[],"profile":{"name":"Chris Guzman","bio":"Chris is a Developer Advocate at Nexmo where he helps developers use their global communications platform.
